{"0": "It should not be hidden from you that the people of Islam had suffered from aggression, iniquity and injustice imposed on them by the Zionist-Crusaders alliance and their collaborators; to the extent that the Muslims' blood became cheap and their wealth became as loot in the hands of the enemies."}
{"1": "All of this the world watched and heard, yet not only didn't respond to these atrocities, but also, with a clear conspiracy between the USA and its allies and under the cover of the iniquitous United Nations, the dispossessed people were even prevented from obtaining arms to defend themselves."}
{"2": "The people of Islam awakened and realised that they are the main target for the aggression of the Zionist-Crusaders alliance."}
{"3": "The latest and the greatest of these aggressions, the greatest incurred by the Muslims since the death of the Prophet (Allah's blessing and salutations on him) is the occupation of the land of the two Holy Places, the foundation of the House of Islam, the place of the revelation, the source of the message and the place of the noble Kaa'ba, the Qiblah of all Muslims, by the armies of the American Crusaders and their allies."}
{"4": "And after a long absence, imposed on the scholars (Ulama) and callers (Da'ees) of Islam, by the iniquitous Crusaders movement under the leadership of the USA, who fears that they, the scholars and callers of Islam, will instigate the Ummah of Islam against its enemies as their ancestors, may Allah be pleased with them, like Ibn Taymiyyah and Al'iz Ibn Abd es-Salaam, did."}
{"5": "And therefore, the Zionist/Crusader alliance resorted to killing and arresting the truthful Ulama and the working Da'ees"}
{"6": "Today we work from the same mountains to lift the iniquity that has been imposed on the Ummah by the Zionist-Crusader alliance, particularly after they have occupied the blessed land around Jerusalem, route of the night-journey of the Prophet (Allah's blessing and salutations on him) and the land of the two Holy Places."}
{"7": "Ignoring the divine Shari'ah law; depriving people of their legitimate rights; allowing the American to occupy the land of the two Holy Places; imprisonment, unjustly, of the sincere scholars."}
{"8": "The inability of the regime to protect the country, and allowing the enemy of the Ummah, the American Crusader forces, to occupy the land for the longest of years."}
{"9": "The Crusader forces became the main cause of our disastrous condition, particularly in the economical aspect of it, due to the unjustified heavy spending on these forces, and as a result of the policies imposed on the country, especially in the field of oil industry, where production is restricted or expanded and prices are fixed to suit the American economy, ignoring the economy of the country."}
{"10": "And why do the Amirs consult those who ignites internal feuds, playing the people against each other and instigate the policemen, the sons of the nation, to abort the reform movement, yet leave in peace and security such traitors who implement the policy of the enemy in order to bleed the financial and the human resources of the Ummah, and leaving the main enemy in the area, the American/Zionist alliance, to enjoy peace and security?!"}
{"11": "The advisor (Zaki Badr, the ex-Egyptian minister of the interior) to Prince Nayeff, Saudi minister of interior, was not acceptable even to his own country; he was sacked from his position there due to the filthy attitude and the aggression he exercised on his own people, yet he was warmly welcomed by Prince Nayeff to assist in sins and aggressions."}
{"12": "No doubts this is the policy of the American/Israeli alliance as they are the first to benefit from this situation."}
{"13": "They refused to be played against each others and to be used by the regime as a tool to carry out the policy of the American/Israeli alliance through their agent in our country: the Saudi regime."}
{"14": "The Zionist/Crusader alliance moves quickly to contain and abort any \"corrective movement\" appearing in the Islamic countries."}
{"15": "Clearly after Belief (Imaan) there is no more important duty than pushing the American enemy out of the holy land."}
{"16": "Utmost effort should be made to prepare and instigate the Ummah against the enemy, the American/Israeli alliance occupying the country of the two Holy Places, and the route of the Apostle (Allah's Blessings and Salutations may be on him) to the Furthest Mosque (Al-Aqsa Mosque)."}
{"17": "The presence of the American Crusader military forces on land, sea and air of the states of the Islamic Gulf is the greatest danger threatening the largest oil reserve in the world."}
{"18": "We also warn the aggressors, the USA, against burning this Islamic wealth (a crime which they may commit in order to prevent it, at the end of the war, from falling in the hands of its legitimate owners and to cause economical damages to the competitors of the USA in Europe or the Far East, particularly Japan which is the major consumer of the oil of the region)."}
{"19": "Division of the land of the two Holy Places, and annexing of the Northern part of it by Israel."}
{"20": "Dividing the land of the two Holy Places is an essential demand of the Zionist/Crusader alliance."}
{"21": "Furthermore the presence of a population of fighters in the south of Yemen, fighting in the cause of Allah, is a strategic threat to the Zionist/Crusader alliance in the area."}
{"22": "The occupier, the USA forces, will control the outcome of the battle for the benefit of the international Kufr."}
{"23": "Half a century ago the rulers promised the Ummah that they would regain the first Qiblah, but fifty years later a new generation arrived and the promises have been changed; Al-Aqsa Mosque has been handed over to the Zionists and the wounds of the Ummah are still bleeding there."}
{"24": "At this time, when the Ummah has not regained the first Qiblah and the route of the journey of the Prophet (Allah's Blessings and Salutations may be on him), and when all that has been mentioned above has transpired, the Saudi regime has harmed the Ummah in the remaining sanctuaries, the Holy city of Makka and the mosque of the Prophet (Al-Masjid An-Nabawy), by calling the Christian army to defend the regime."}
{"25": "The land was filled with the military bases of the USA and the Allies."}
{"26": "You know more than anybody else about the intention, the size of and the danger of the presence of the US military bases in the area."}
{"27": "\"Expel the polytheists from the Arab Peninsula;\" narrated by Al-Bukhari; and: \"If I survive, Allah willing, I will expel the Jews and the Christians out of the Arab Peninsula;\" Saheeh Al-Jame'-As-Sagheer."}
{"28": "Especially when the civil and the military infrastructures of Iraq were savagely destroyed, showing the depth of the Zionist/Crusaders hatred to the Muslims and their children, and also since the rejection of the idea of replacing the Crusaders forces by an Islamic force composed of the sons of the country and other Muslim people."}
{"29": "Moreover, these excuses and the claim itself were demolished and wiped out by the sequence of speeches given by the leaders of the Kuffaar in America."}
{"30": "The imprisoned Sheikh Safar Al-Hawali, may Allah hasten his release, wrote a book of seventy pages; in it he presented evidence and proof that the presence of the Americans in the Arab Peninsula is a pre-planned military occupation."}
{"31": "In 1304 A.H (1936 CE) the awakened Muslim nation of Palestine started their great struggle, Jihad, against the British occupying forces."}
{"32": "Britain was impotent to stop the Mujahideen and their Jihad, but their devil inspired that there is no way to stop the armed struggle in Palestine unless through their agent King Abdul Azeez, who managed to deceives the Mujahideen."}
{"33": "King Abdul Azeez carried out his duty to his British masters."}
{"34": "The King said, \"The issue is simple - the American and the Alliance forces will leave the area in a few months."}
{"35": "The regime has made no confession of its ineffectiveness, and carries on lying to the people, claiming that the Americans will leave."}
{"36": "The regime is fully responsible for what has been incurred by the country and the nation; however, the occupying American enemy is the principle and the main cause of the situation."}
{"37": "It is incredible that our country is the world's largest buyer of arms from the USA and the area's biggest commercial partner with the Americans, who are assisting their Zionist brothers in occupying Palestine and in evicting and killing the Muslims there, by providing arms, men, and financial support."}
{"38": "By doing so we would have taken part in (the process of) cleansing our sanctuaries from the Crusaders and the Zionists and forcing them, by the Permission of Allah, to leave disappointed and defeated."}
{"39": "We expect the women of the land of the two Holy Places and other countries to carry out their role in boycotting American goods."}
{"40": "Economic boycotting of American goods is a very effective weapon of hitting and weakening the enemy, and it is not under the control of the security forces of the regime."}
{"41": "While some well-known individuals have hesitated in their duty of defending Islam and saving themselves and their wealth from the injustice, aggression and terror exercised by the government, the youth (may Allah protect them) are steadfast and raise the banner of Jihad against the American-Zionist alliance occupying the sanctuaries of Islam."}
{"42": "And the story of Abd ur-Rahman Ibn Awf about Ummayyah Ibn Khalaf shows the extent of Bilal's (may Allah be pleased with him) persistence in killing the head of the Kuffar: \"The head of Kufr is Ummayyah Ibn Khalaf..."}
{"43": "A few days ago the news agencies had reported that the Defence Secretary of the Crusading Americans had said that the explosions at Riyadh and Al-Khobar had taught him one lesson: that is not to withdraw when attacked by cowardly terrorists."}
{"44": "The sons of the land of the two Holy Places had come out to fight against the Russians in Afghanistan, the Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina, and today they are fighting in Chechnya, and by the Permission of Allah, they have been made victorious over your partner, the Russians."}
{"45": "Those youths know that the reward in fighting you, the USA, is double than the reward in fighting someone not from the People of the Book."}
{"46": "The youths hold you responsible for all of the killings and evictions of the Muslims and the violation of the sanctuaries, carried out by your Zionist brothers in Lebanon; you openly supplied them with arms and finance."}
{"47": "You, the USA, together with the Saudi regime, are responsible for the shedding of the blood of these innocent children."}
{"48": "They are even more determined after the martyrdom of the four heroes who bombed the Americans in Riyadh."}
{"49": "Those youth raised high the head of the Ummah and humiliated the Americans, the occupier, by their operation in Riyadh."}
{"50": "Your brothers in Palestine and in the land of the two Holy Places are calling for your help and asking you to take part in fighting against your enemy and their enemy, the Americans and the Israelis."}
{"51": "And the Zionist Jews fiddle as they wish with the Al-Aqsa Mosque, the route of the ascent of the Messenger of Allah (Allah's blessing and salutation upon him)."}
{"52": "God Almighty hit the United States at its most vulnerable spot."}
{"53": "When Almighty God rendered successful a convoy of Muslims, the vanguards of Islam, He allowed them to destroy the United States."}
{"54": "But if the sword falls on the United States after 80 years, hypocrisy raises its head lamenting the deaths of these killers who tampered with the\nblood, honour, and holy places of the Muslims."}
{"55": "In the aftermath of this event and now that senior US officials have spoken, beginning with Bush, the head of the world's infidels, and\nwhoever supports him, every Muslim should rush to defend his religion."}
{"56": "As for the United States, I tell it and its land of Mohammed\npeople these few words: I swear by Almighty God who raised the heavens without pillars that neither the United States nor he who lives in the United States will enjoy security before we can see it as a reality in Palestine and before all the infidel armies leave the land of Mohammed"}
{"57": "Here is America struck by God Almighty in one of its vital organs, so that its greatest buildings are destroyed."}
{"58": "America has been filled with horror from north to south and east to west, and thanks be to God."}
{"59": "What America is tasting now is only a copy of what we have tasted."}
{"60": "God has blessed a group of vanguard Muslims, the forefront of Islam, to destroy America."}
{"61": "But when a few more than 10 were killed in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam, Afghanistan and Iraq were bombed and hypocrisy stood behind the head of international infidels: the modern world's symbol of paganism, America, and its allies."}
{"62": "The British handed over Palestine, with your help and your support, to the Jews, who have occupied it for more than 50 years; years overflowing with oppression, tyranny, crimes, killing, expulsion, destruction and devastation."}
{"63": "The creation and continuation of Israel is one of the greatest crimes, and you are the leaders of its criminals."}
{"64": "And of course, there is no need to explain and prove the degree of American support for Israel."}
{"65": "The creation of Israel is a crime which must be erased."}
{"66": "It brings us both laughter and tears to see that you have not yet tired of repeating your fabricated lies that the Jews have a historical right to Palestine, as it was promised to them in the Torah."}
{"67": "Thus the American people have chosen, consented to, and affirmed their support for the Israeli oppression of the Palestinians, the occupation and usurpation of their land, and its continuous killing, torture, punishment and expulsion of the Palestinians."}
{"68": "(b) The American people are the ones who pay the taxes which fund the planes that bomb us in Afghanistan, the tanks that strike and destroy our homes in Palestine, the armies which occupy our lands in the Arabian Gulf, and the feats which ensure the blockade of Iraq."}
{"69": "These tax dollars are given to Israel for it to continue to attack us and penetrate our lands."}
{"70": "So the American people are the ones who fund the attacks against us, and they are the ones who oversee the expenditure of these monies in the way they wish, through their elected candidates."}
{"71": "The American people are the ones who employ both their men and their women in the American Forces which attack us."}
{"72": "This is why the American people cannot be not innocent of all the crimes committed by the Americans and Jews against us."}
{"73": "The American Government and press still refuses to answer the question:"}
{"74": "America does not understand the language of manners and principles, so we are addressing it using the language it understands."}
{"75": "Islam is the religion of all the prophets, and makes no distinction between them - peace be upon them all."}
{"76": "Go ahead and boast to the nations of man, that you brought them AIDS as a Satanic American Invention."}
{"77": "Behind them stand the Jews, who control your policies, media and economy."}
{"78": "The freedom and democracy that you call to is for yourselves and for white race only; as for the rest of the world, you impose upon them your monstrous, destructive policies and Governments, which you call the 'American friends'."}
{"79": "In America, you captured thousands the Muslims and Arabs, took them into custody with neither reason, court trial, nor even disclosing their names."}
{"80": "What happens in Guantanamo is a historical embarrassment to America and its values, and it screams into your faces - you hypocrites, \"What is the value of your signature on any agreement or treaty?"}
{"81": "(4) We also advise you to stop supporting Israel, and to end your support of the Indians in Kashmir, the Russians against the Chechens and to also cease supporting the Manila Government against the Muslims in Southern Philippines."}
{"82": "We also call you to deal with us and interact with us on the basis of mutual interests and benefits, rather than the policies of sub dual, theft and occupation, and not to continue your policy of supporting the Jews because this will result in more disasters for you."}
{"83": "If the Americans refuse to listen to our advice and the goodness, guidance and righteousness that we call them to, then be aware that you will lose this Crusade Bush began, just like the other previous Crusades in which you were humiliated by the hands of the Mujahideen, feeing to your home in great silence and disgrace."}
{"84": "If the Americans do not respond, then their fate will be that of the Soviets who fed from Afghanistan to deal with their military defeat, political breakup, ideological downfall, and economic bankruptcy."}
{"85": "This is our message to the Americans, as an answer to theirs."}
{"86": "Even though we are in the fourth year after the events of September 11th, Bush is still engaged in distortion, deception and hiding from you the real causes."}
{"87": "But after it became unbearable and we witnessed the oppression and tyranny of the American/Israeli coalition against our people in Palestine and Lebanon, it came to my mind."}
{"88": "The events that affected my soul in a direct way started in 1982 when America permitted the Israelis to invade Lebanon and the American Sixth Fleet helped them in that."}
{"89": "And as I looked at those demolished towers in Lebanon, it entered my mind that we should punish the oppressor in kind and that we should destroy towers in America in order that they taste some of what we tasted and so that they be deterred from killing our women and children."}
{"90": "This resemblance began after the visits of Bush Sr to the region."}
{"91": "At a time when some of our compatriots were dazzled by America and hoping that these visits would have an effect on our countries, all of a sudden he was affected by those monarchies and military regimes, and became envious of their remaining decades in their positions, to embezzle the public wealth of the nation without supervision or accounting."}
{"92": "So we are continuing this policy in bleeding America to the point of bankruptcy."}
{"93": "And it was to these sorts of notions and their like that the British diplomat and others were referring in their lectures at the Royal Institute of International Affairs."}
{"94": "And even more dangerous and bitter for America is that the mujahidin recently forced Bush to resort to emergency funds to continue the fight in Afghanistan and Iraq, which is evidence of the success of the bleed-until-bankruptcy plan - with Allah's permission."}
{"95": "It is the American people and their economy."}
{"96": "It never occurred to us that the commander-in-chief of the American armed forces would abandon 50,000 of his citizens in the twin towers to face those great horrors alone, the time when they most needed him."}
{"97": "And it's no secret to you that the thinkers and perceptive ones from among the Americans warned Bush before the war and told him: \"All that you want for securing America and removing the weapons of mass destruction - assuming they exist - is available to you, and the nations of the world are with you in the inspections, and it is in the interest of America that it not be thrust into an unjustified war with an unknown outcome."}
{"98": "But the darkness of the black gold blurred his vision and insight, and he gave priority to private interests over the public interests of America."}
{"99": "So the war went ahead, the death toll rose, the American economy bled, and Bush became embroiled in the swamps of Iraq that threaten his future."}
{"100": "It is as if they were telling you, the people of America:"}
