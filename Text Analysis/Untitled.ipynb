       "'We are here in the middle hour of our grief. So many have suffered so great a loss, and today we express our nation\\'s sorrow. We come before God to pray for the missing and the dead, and for those who loved them. On Tuesday, our country was attacked with deliberate and massive cruelty. We have seen the images of fire and ashes and bent steel.\\nNow come the names, the list of casualties we are only beginning to read:\\nThey are the names of men and women who began their day at a desk or in an airport, busy with life.\\nThey are the names of people who faced death and in their last moments called home to say, be brave and I love you.\\nThey are the names of passengers who defied their murderers and prevented the murder of others on the ground.\\nThey are the names of men and women who wore the uniform of the United States and died at their posts.\\nThey are the names of rescuers -- the ones whom death found running up the stairs and into the fires to help others.\\nWe will read all these names. We will linger over them and learn their stories, and many Americans will weep.\\nTo the children and parents and spouses and families and friends of the lost, we offer the deepest sympathy of the nation. And I assure you, you are not alone. Just three days removed from these events, Americans do not yet have the distance of history, but our responsibility to history is already clear: to answer these attacks and rid the world of evil.\\nWar has been waged against us by stealth and deceit and murder. This nation is peaceful, but fierce when stirred to anger. This conflict was begun on the timing and terms of others; it will end in a way and at an hour of our choosing. Our purpose as a nation is firm, yet our wounds as a people are recent and unhealed and lead us to pray. In many of our prayers this week, there\\'s a searching and an honesty. At St. Patrick\\'s Cathedral in New York, on Tuesday, a woman said, \"I pray to God to give us a sign that He\\'s still here.\"\\nOthers have prayed for the same, searching hospital to hospital, carrying pictures of those still missing. God\\'s signs are not always the ones we look for. We learn in tragedy that His purposes are not always our own, yet the prayers of private suffering, whether in our homes or in this great cathedral are known and heard and understood. There are prayers that help us last through the day or endure the night. There are prayers of friends and strangers that give us strength for the journey, and there are prayers that yield our will to a Will greater than our own.\\nThis world He created is of moral design. Grief and tragedy and hatred are only for a time. Goodness, remembrance and love have no end, and the Lord of life holds all who die and all who mourn.\\nIt is said that adversity introduces us to ourselves. This is true of a nation as well. In this trial, we have been reminded and the world has seen that our fellow Americans are generous and kind, resourceful and brave.\\nWe see our national character in rescuers working past exhaustion, in long lines of blood donors, in thousands of citizens who have asked to work and serve in any way possible.\\nAnd we have seen our national character in eloquent acts of sacrifice:\\nInside the World Trade Center, one man who could have saved himself stayed until the end and at the side of his quadriplegic friend.\\nA beloved priest died giving the last rites to a firefighter.\\nTwo office workers, finding a disabled stranger, carried her down 68 floors to safety.\\nA group of men drove through the night from Dallas to Washington to bring skin grafts for burned victims.\\nIn these acts and many others, Americans showed a deep commitment to one another and an abiding love for our country.\\nToday, we feel what Franklin Roosevelt called, \"the warm courage of national unity.\" This is a unity of every faith and every background. It has joined together political parties and both houses of Congress. It is evident in services of prayer and candlelight vigils and American flags, which are displayed in pride and waved in defiance. Our unity is a kinship of grief and a steadfast resolve to prevail against our enemies. And this unity against terror is now extending across the world.\\nAmerica is a nation full of good fortune, with so much to be grateful for, but we are not spared from suffering. In every generation, the world has produced enemies of human freedom. They have attacked America because we are freedom\\'s home and defender, and the commitment of our Fathers is now the calling of our time.\\nOn this national day of prayer and remembrance, we ask Almighty God to watch over our nation and grant us patience and resolve in all that is to come. We pray that He will comfort and console those who now walk in sorrow. We thank Him for each life we now must mourn, and the promise of a life to come.\\nAs we\\'ve been assured, neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities, nor powers nor things present nor things to come nor height nor depth can separate us from God\\'s love.1 May He bless the souls of the departed. May He comfort our own. And may He always guide our country.\\nGod bless America./nGood morning. This weekend I am engaged in extensive sessions with members of my National Security Council, as we plan a comprehensive assault on terrorism. This will be a different kind of conflict against a different kind of enemy.\\nThis is a conflict without battlefields or beachheads, a conflict with opponents who believe they are invisible. Yet, they are mistaken. They will be exposed, and they will discover what others in the past have learned: Those who make war against the United States have chosen their own destruction. Victory against terrorism will not take place in a single battle, but in a series of decisive actions against terrorist organizations and those who harbor and support them.\\nWe are planning a broad and sustained campaign to secure our country and eradicate the evil of terrorism. And we are determined to see this conflict through. Americans of every faith and background are committed to this goal.\\nYesterday I visited the site of the destruction in New York City and saw an amazing spirit of sacrifice and patriotism and defiance. I met with rescuers who have worked past exhaustion, who cheered for our country and the great cause we have entered.\\nIn Washington, D.C., the political parties and both Houses of Congress have shown a remarkable unity, and I\\'m deeply grateful. A terrorist attack designed to tear us apart has instead bound us together as a nation. Over the past few days, we have learned much about American courage -- the courage of firefighters and police officers who suffered so great a loss, the courage of passengers aboard United 93 who may well have fought with the hijackers and saved many lives on the ground.\\nNow we honor those who died, and prepare to respond to these attacks on our nation. I will not settle for a token act. Our response must be sweeping, sustained, and effective. We have much do to, and much to ask of the American people.\\nYou will be asked for your patience -- for the conflict will not be short. You will be asked for resolve -- for the conflict will not be easy. You will be asked for your strength, because the course to victory may be long.\\nIn the past week, we have seen the American people at their very best everywhere in America. Citizens have come together to pray, to give blood, to fly our country\\'s flag. Americans are coming together to share their grief and gain strength from one another.\\nGreat tragedy has come to us, and we are meeting it with the best that is in our country, with courage and concern for others: because this is America. This is who we are. This is what our enemies hate and have attacked. And this is why we will prevail.\\nThank you for listening./nThank you all very much for your hospitality. We\\'ve just had a -- wide-ranging discussions on -- on the matter at hand. Like the good folks standing with me, the American people were appalled and outraged at last Tuesday\\'s attacks. And so were Muslims all across the world. Both Americans and Muslim friends and citizens, tax-paying citizens, and Muslims in nations were just appalled and could not believe what -- what we saw on our TV screens.\\nThese acts of violence against innocents violate the fundamental tenets of the Islamic faith. And it\\'s important for my fellow Americans to understand that. The English translation is not as eloquent as the original Arabic, but let me quote from the Koran, itself: In the long run, evil in the extreme will be the end of those who do evil. For that they rejected the signs of Allah and held them up to ridicule.1\\nThe face of terror is not the true faith of Islam. That\\'s not what Islam is all about. Islam is peace. These terrorists don\\'t represent peace. They represent evil and war. When we think of Islam we think of a faith that brings comfort to a billion people around the world. Billions of people find comfort and solace and peace. And that\\'s made brothers and sisters out of every race -- out of every race. America counts millions of Muslims amongst our citizens, and Muslims make an incredibly valuable contribution to our country. Muslims are doctors, lawyers, law professors, members of the military, entrepreneurs, shopkeepers, moms and dads. And they need to be treated with respect. In our anger and emotion, our fellow Americans must treat each other with respect.\\nWomen who cover their heads in this country must feel comfortable going outside their homes. Moms who wear cover must be not intimidated in America. That\\'s not the America I know. That\\'s not the America I value. I\\'ve been told that some fear to leave; some don\\'t want to go shopping for their families; some don\\'t want to go about their ordinary daily routines because, by wearing cover, they\\'re afraid they\\'ll be intimidated. That should not and that will not stand in America. Those who feel like they can intimidate our fellow citizens to take out their anger don\\'t represent the best of America, they represent the worst of humankind, and they should be ashamed of that kind of behavior.\\nNow this is a great country. It\\'s a great country because we share the same values of respect and dignity and human worth. And it is my honor to be meeting with leaders who feel just the same way I do. They\\'re outraged. They\\'re sad. They love America just as much as I do.\\n\\nAnd I want to thank you all for giving me a chance to come by.\\n\\nAnd may God bless us all.\\n\\nThank you./nMr. Speaker, Mr. President Pro Tempore, members of Congress, and fellow Americans:\\nIn the normal course of events, Presidents come to this chamber to report on the state of the Union. Tonight, no such report is needed. It has already been delivered by the American people.\\nWe have seen it in the courage of passengers, who rushed terrorists to save others on the ground -- passengers like an exceptional man named Todd Beamer. And would you please help me to welcome his wife, Lisa Beamer, here tonight. We have seen the state of our Union in the endurance of rescuers, working past exhaustion. We\\'ve seen the unfurling of flags, the lighting of candles, the giving of blood, the saying of prayers -- in English, Hebrew, and Arabic. We have seen the decency of a loving and giving people who have made the grief of strangers their own. My fellow citizens, for the last nine days, the entire world has seen for itself the state of our Union -- and it is strong.\\nTonight we are a country awakened to danger and called to defend freedom. Our grief has turned to anger, and anger to resolution. Whether we bring our enemies to justice, or bring justice to our enemies, justice will be done. I thank the Congress for its leadership at such an important time. All of America was touched on the evening of the tragedy to see Republicans and Democrats joined together on the steps of this Capitol, singing \"God Bless America.\" And you did more than sing; you acted, by delivering 40 billion dollars to rebuild our communities and meet the needs of our military. Speaker Hastert, Minority Leader Gephardt, Majority Leader Daschle, and Senator Lott, I thank you for your friendship, for your leadership, and for your service to our country. And on behalf of the American people, I thank the world for its outpouring of support. America will never forget the sounds of our National Anthem playing at Buckingham Palace, on the streets of Paris, and at Berlin\\'s Brandenburg Gate.\\nWe will not forget South Korean children gathering to pray outside our embassy in Seoul, or the prayers of sympathy offered at a mosque in Cairo. We will not forget moments of silence and days of mourning in Australia and Africa and Latin America. Nor will we forget the citizens of 80 other nations who died with our own: dozens of Pakistanis; more than 130 Israelis; more than 250 citizens of India; men and women from El Salvador, Iran, Mexico, and Japan; and hundreds of British citizens. America has no truer friend than Great Britain. Once again, we are joined together in a great cause -- so honored the British Prime Minister has crossed an ocean to show his unity with America. Thank you for coming, friend.\\nOn September the 11th, enemies of freedom committed an act of war against our country. Americans have known wars -- but for the past 136 years, they have been wars on foreign soil, except for one Sunday in 1941. Americans have known the casualties of war -- but not at the center of a great city on a peaceful morning. Americans have known surprise attacks -- but never before on thousands of civilians. All of this was brought upon us in a single day -- and night fell on a different world, a world where freedom itself is under attack. Americans have many questions tonight. Americans are asking: Who attacked our country? The evidence we have gathered all points to a collection of loosely affiliated terrorist organizations known as al Qaeda. They are some of the murderers indicted for bombing American embassies in Tanzania and Kenya, and responsible for bombing the USS Cole. Al Qaeda is to terror what the mafia is to crime. But its goal is not making money; its goal is remaking the world -- and imposing its radical beliefs on people everywhere.\\nThe terrorists practice a fringe form of Islamic extremism that has been rejected by Muslim scholars and the vast majority of Muslim clerics, a fringe movement that perverts the peaceful teachings of Islam. The terrorists\\' directive commands them to kill Christians and Jews, to kill all Americans, and make no distinctions among military and civilians, including women and children. This group and its leader -- a person named Usama bin Laden -- are linked to many other organizations in different countries, including the Egyptian Islamic Jihad and the Islamic Movement of Uzbekistan. There are thousands of these terrorists in more than 60 countries. They are recruited from their own nations and neighborhoods and brought to camps in places like Afghanistan, where they are trained in the tactics of terror. They are sent back to their homes or sent to hide in countries around the world to plot evil and destruction.\\nThe leadership of al Qaeda has great influence in Afghanistan and supports the Taliban regime in controlling most of that country. In Afghanistan, we see al Qaeda\\'s vision for the world. Afghanistan\\'s people have been brutalized; many are starving and many have fled. Women are not allowed to attend school. You can be jailed for owning a television. Religion can be practiced only as their leaders dictate. A man can be jailed in Afghanistan if his beard is not long enough. \\nThe United States respects the people of Afghanistan. After all, we are currently its largest source of humanitarian aid; but we condemn the Taliban regime. It is not only repressing its own people, it is threatening people everywhere by sponsoring and sheltering and supplying terrorists. By aiding and abetting murder, the Taliban regime is committing murder.\\nAnd tonight, the United States of America makes the following demands on the Taliban: Deliver to United States authorities all the leaders of al Qaeda who hide in your land. Release all foreign nationals, including American citizens, you have unjustly imprisoned. Protect foreign journalists, diplomats, and aid workers in your country. Close immediately and permanently every terrorist training camp in Afghanistan, and hand over every terrorist, and every person in their support structure, to appropriate authorities. Give the United States full access to terrorist training camps, so we can make sure they are no longer operating. These demands are not open to negotiation or discussion. The Taliban must act, and act immediately. They will hand over the terrorists, or they will share in their fate.\\nI also want to speak tonight directly to Muslims throughout the world. We respect your faith. It\\'s practiced freely by many millions of Americans, and by millions more in countries that America counts as friends. Its teachings are good and peaceful, and those who commit evil in the name of Allah blaspheme the name of Allah. The terrorists are traitors to their own faith, trying, in effect, to hijack Islam itself. The enemy of America is not our many Muslim friends; it is not our many Arab friends. Our enemy is a radical network of terrorists, and every government that supports them. Our war on terror begins with al Qaeda, but it does not end there. It will not end until every terrorist group of global reach has been found, stopped, and defeated.\\nAmericans are asking, why do they hate us? They hate what they see right here in this chamber -- a democratically elected government. Their leaders are self-appointed. They hate our freedoms -- our freedom of religion, our freedom of speech, our freedom to vote and assemble and disagree with each other. They want to overthrow existing governments in many Muslim countries, such as Egypt, Saudi Arabia, and Jordan. They want to drive Israel out of the Middle East. They want to drive Christians and Jews out of vast regions of Asia and Africa. These terrorists kill not merely to end lives, but to disrupt and end a way of life. With every atrocity, they hope that America grows fearful, retreating from the world and forsaking our friends. They stand against us, because we stand in their way.\\nWe are not deceived by their pretenses to piety. We have seen their kind before. They are the heirs of all the murderous ideologies of the 20th century. By sacrificing human life to serve their radical visions -- by abandoning every value except the will to power -- they follow in the path of fascism, Nazism, and totalitarianism. And they will follow that path all the way, to where it ends: in history\\'s unmarked grave of discarded lies. Americans are asking: How will we fight and win this war? We will direct every resource at our command -- every means of diplomacy, every tool of intelligence, every instrument of law enforcement, every financial influence, and every necessary weapon of war -- to the disruption and to the defeat of the global terror network.\\nNow this war will not be like the war against Iraq a decade ago, with a decisive liberation of territory and a swift conclusion. It will not look like the air war above Kosovo two years ago, where no ground troops were used and not a single American was lost in combat. Our response involves far more than instant retaliation and isolated strikes. Americans should not expect one battle, but a lengthy campaign, unlike any other we have ever seen. It may include dramatic strikes, visible on TV, and covert operations, secret even in success. We will starve terrorists of funding, turn them one against another, drive them from place to place, until there is no refuge or no rest. And we will pursue nations that provide aid or safe haven to terrorism. Every nation, in every region, now has a decision to make. Either you are with us, or you are with the terrorists. From this day forward, any nation that continues to harbor or support terrorism will be regarded by the United States as a hostile regime.\\nOur nation has been put on notice: We\\'re not immune from attack. We will take defensive measures against terrorism to protect Americans. Today, dozens of federal departments and agencies, as well as state and local governments, have responsibilities affecting homeland security. These efforts must be coordinated at the highest level. So tonight, I announce the creation of a Cabinet-level position reporting directly to me -- the Office of Homeland Security. And tonight I also announce a distinguished American to lead this effort, to strengthen American security: a military veteran, an effective governor, a true patriot, a trusted friend -- Pennsylvania\\'s Tom Ridge. He will lead, oversee, and coordinate a comprehensive national strategy to safeguard our country against terrorism, and respond to any attacks that may come.\\nThese measures are essential. But the only way to defeat terrorism as a threat to our way of life is to stop it, eliminate it, and destroy it where it grows. Many will be involved in this effort, from FBI agents to intelligence operatives to the reservists we have called to active duty. All deserve our thanks, and all have our prayers. And tonight, a few miles from the damaged Pentagon, I have a message for our military: Be ready. I\\'ve called the Armed Forces to alert, and there is a reason. The hour is coming when America will act, and you will make us proud. This is not, however, just America\\'s fight. And what is at stake is not just America\\'s freedom. This is the world\\'s fight. This is civilization\\'s fight. This is the fight of all who believe in progress and pluralism, tolerance and freedom.\\nWe ask every nation to join us. We will ask, and we will need, the help of police forces, intelligence services, and banking systems around the world. The United States is grateful that many nations and many international organizations have already responded -- with sympathy and with support. Nations from Latin America, to Asia, to Africa, to Europe, to the Islamic world. Perhaps the NATO Charter reflects best the attitude of the world: An attack on one is an attack on all. The civilized world is rallying to America\\'s side. They understand that if this terror goes unpunished, their own cities, their own citizens may be next. Terror, unanswered, can not only bring down buildings, it can threaten the stability of legitimate governments. And you know what? We\\'re not going to allow it.\\nAmericans are asking: What is expected of us? I ask you to live your lives, and hug your children. I know many citizens have fears tonight, and I ask you to be calm and resolute, even in the face of a continuing threat. I ask you to uphold the values of America, and remember why so many have come here. We are in a fight for our principles, and our first responsibility is to live by them. No one should be singled out for unfair treatment or unkind words because of their ethnic background or religious faith. I ask you to continue to support the victims of this tragedy with your contributions. Those who want to give can go to a central source of information, libertyunites.org, to find the names of groups providing direct help in New York, Pennsylvania, and Virginia.\\nThe thousands of FBI agents who are now at work in this investigation may need your cooperation, and I ask you to give it. I ask for your patience, with the delays and inconveniences that may accompany tighter security; and for your patience in what will be a long struggle. I ask your continued participation and confidence in the American economy. Terrorists attacked a symbol of American prosperity. They did not touch its source. America is successful because of the hard work, and creativity, and enterprise of our people. These were the true strengths of our economy before September 11th, and they are our strengths today. And, finally, please continue praying for the victims of terror and their families, for those in uniform, and for our great country. Prayer has comforted us in sorrow, and will help strengthen us for the journey ahead.\\nTonight I thank my fellow Americans for what you have already done and for what you will do. And ladies and gentlemen of the Congress, I thank you, their representatives, for what you have already done and for what we will do together. Tonight, we face new and sudden national challenges. We will come together to improve air safety, to dramatically expand the number of air marshals on domestic flights, and take new measures to prevent hijacking. We will come together to promote stability and keep our airlines flying, with direct assistance during this emergency. We will come together to give law enforcement the additional tools it needs to track down terror here at home. We will come together to strengthen our intelligence capabilities to know the plans of terrorists before they act, and to find them before they strike.\\nWe will come together to take active steps that strengthen America\\'s economy, and put our people back to work. Tonight we welcome two leaders who embody the extraordinary spirit of all New Yorkers: Governor George Pataki, and Mayor Rudolph Giuliani. As a symbol of America\\'s resolve, my administration will work with Congress, and these two leaders, to show the world that we will rebuild New York City.\\nAfter all that has just passed -- all the lives taken, and all the possibilities and hopes that died with them -- it is natural to wonder if America\\'s future is one of fear.  Some speak of an age of terror. I know there are struggles ahead, and dangers to face. But this country will define our times, not be defined by them. As long as the United States of America is determined and strong, this will not be an age of terror; this will be an age of liberty, here and across the world.\\nGreat harm has been done to us. We have suffered great loss. And in our grief and anger we have found our mission and our moment. Freedom and fear are at war.  The advance of human freedom -- the great achievement of our time, and the great hope of every time -- now depends on us. Our nation, this generation will lift a dark threat of violence from our people and our future. We will rally the world to this cause by our efforts, by our courage. We will not tire, we will not falter, and we will not fail.\\nIt is my hope that in the months and years ahead, life will return almost to normal.  We\\'ll go back to our lives and routines, and that is good.  Even grief recedes with time and grace. But our resolve must not pass. Each of us will remember what happened that day, and to whom it happened. We\\'ll remember the moment the news came -- where we were and what we were doing. Some will remember an image of a fire, or a story of rescue. Some will carry memories of a face and a voice gone forever.\\nAnd I will carry this: It is the police shield of a man named George Howard, who died at the World Trade Center trying to save others. It was given to me by his mom, Arlene, as a proud memorial to her son. It is my reminder of lives that ended, and a task that does not end. I will not forget this wound to our country or those who inflicted it. I will not yield; I will not rest; I will not relent in waging this struggle for freedom and security for the American people. The course of this conflict is not known, yet its outcome is certain. Freedom and fear, justice and cruelty, have always been at war, and we know that God is not neutral between them.\\nFellow citizens, we\\'ll meet violence with patient justice -- assured of the rightness of our cause, and confident of the victories to come. In all that lies before us, may God grant us wisdom, and may He watch over the United States of America.\\nThank you./nGood evening. \\nToday, our fellow citizens, our way of life, our very freedom came under attack in a series of deliberate and deadly terrorist acts. The victims were in airplanes or in their offices: secretaries, business men and women, military and federal workers, moms and dads, friends and neighbors. Thousands of lives were suddenly ended by evil, despicable acts of terror. The pictures of airplanes flying into buildings, fires burning, huge -- huge structures collapsing have filled us with disbelief, terrible sadness, and a quiet, unyielding anger. These acts of mass murder were intended to frighten our nation into chaos and retreat. But they have failed. Our country is strong.\\nA great people has been moved to defend a great nation. Terrorist attacks can shake the foundations of our biggest buildings, but they cannot touch the foundation of America. These acts shatter steel, but they cannot dent the steel of American resolve. America was targeted for attack because we\\'re the brightest beacon for freedom and opportunity in the world. And no one will keep that light from shining. Today, our nation saw evil -- the very worst of human nature -- and we responded with the best of America. With the daring of our rescue workers, with the caring for strangers and neighbors who came to give blood and help in any way they could.\\nImmediately following the first attack, I implemented our government\\'s emergency response plans. Our military is powerful, and it\\'s prepared. Our emergency teams are working in New York City and Washington D.C. to help with local rescue efforts. Our first priority is to get help to those who have been injured, and to take every precaution to protect our citizens at home and around the world from further attacks. The functions of our government continue without interruption. Federal agencies in Washington which had to be evacuated today are reopening for essential personnel tonight and will be open for business tomorrow. Our financial institutions remain strong, and the American economy will be open for business as well.\\nThe search is underway for those who were behind these evil acts. I have directed the full resources of our intelligence and law enforcement communities to find those responsible and to bring them to justice. We will make no distinction between the terrorists who committed these acts and those who harbor them.\\nI appreciate so very much the members of Congress who have joined me in strongly condemning these attacks. And on behalf of the American people, I thank the many world leaders who have called to offer their condolences and assistance. America and our friends and allies join with all those who want peace and security in the world, and we stand together to win the war against terrorism.\\nTonight, I ask for your prayers for all those who grieve, for the children whose worlds have been shattered, for all whose sense of safety and security has been threatened. And I pray they will be comforted by a Power greater than any of us, spoken through the ages in Psalm 23:\\nEven though I walk through the valley of the shadow of death, I fear no evil for you are with me.\\nThis is a day when all Americans from every walk of life unite in our resolve for justice and peace. America has stood down enemies before, and we will do so this time. None of us will ever forget this day, yet we go forward to defend freedom and all that is good and just in our world.\\nThank you. Good night. And God bless America./nGood afternoon. On my orders, the United States military has begun strikes against Al Qaeda terrorist training camps and military installations of the Taliban regime in Afghanistan. These carefully targeted actions are designed to disrupt the use of Afghanistan as a terrorist base of operations and to attack the military capability of the Taliban regime.\\nWe are joined in this operation by our staunch friend, Great Britain. Other close friends, including Canada, Australia, Germany and France, have pledged forces as the operation unfolds. More than 40 countries in the Middle East, Africa, Europe, and across Asia have granted air transit or landing rights. Many more have shared intelligence. We are supported by the collective will of the world.\\nMore than two weeks ago, I gave Taliban leaders a series of clear and specific demands: Close terrorist training camps; hand over leaders of the Al Qaeda network; and return all foreign nationals, including American citizens, unjustly detained in your country. None of these demands was met. And now, the Taliban will pay a price.\\nBy destroying camps and disrupting communications, we will make it more difficult for the terror network to train new recruits and coordinate their evil plans. Initially the terrorists may burrow deeper into caves and other entrenched hiding places. Our military action is also designed to clear the way for sustained, comprehensive, and relentless operations to drive them out and bring them to justice.\\nAt the same time, the oppressed people of Afghanistan will know the generosity of America and our allies. As we strike military targets, we will also drop food, medicine, and supplies to the starving and suffering men and women and children of Afghanistan. The United States of America is a friend to the Afghan people, and we are the friends of almost a billion worldwide who practice the Islamic faith. The United States of America is an enemy of those who aid terrorists and of the barbaric criminals who profane a great religion by committing murder in its name. This military action is a part of our campaign against terrorism, another front in a war that has already been joined through diplomacy, intelligence, the freezing of financial assets, and the arrests of known terrorists by law-enforcement agents in 38 countries.\\nGiven the nature and reach of our enemies, we will win this conflict by the patient accumulation of successes, by meeting a series of challenges with determination, and will, and purpose. Today we focus on Afghanistan, but the battle is broader. Every nation has a choice to make. In this conflict, there is no neutral ground. If any government sponsors the outlaws and killers of innocence, they have become outlaws and murderers themselves. And they will take that lonely path at their own peril.\\nI\\'m speaking to you today from the Treaty Room of the White House, a place where American presidents have worked for peace. We\\'re a peaceful nation. Yet, as we have learned, so suddenly and so tragically, there can be no peace in a world of sudden terror. In the face of today\\'s new threat, the only way to pursue peace is to pursue those who threaten it. We did not ask for this mission, but we will fulfill it.\\nThe name of today\\'s military operation is Enduring Freedom. We defend not only our precious freedoms, but also the freedom of people everywhere to live and raise their children free from fear.\\nI know many Americans feel fear today. And our government is taking strong precautions. All law enforcement and intelligence agencies are working aggressively around America, around the world -- and around the clock. At my request, many governors have activated the National Guard to strengthen airport security. We have called up reserves to reinforce our military capability and strengthen the protection of our homeland.\\nIn the months ahead, our patience will be one of our strengths -- patience with the long waits that will result from tighter security, patience and understanding that it will take time to achieve our goals, patience in all the sacrifices that may come. Today, those sacrifices are being made by members of our armed forces who now defend us so far from home, and by their proud and worried families.\\nA Commander-in-Chief sends America\\'s sons and daughters into battle in a foreign land only after the greatest care and a lot of prayer. We ask a lot of those who wear our uniform. We ask them to leave their loved ones, to travel great distances, to risk injury, even to be prepared to make the ultimate sacrifice of their lives. They are dedicated. They are honorable. They represent the best of our country, and we are grateful. To all the men and women in our military -- every sailor, every soldier, every airman, every Coast Guardsman, every Marine -- I say this: Your mission is defined; your objectives are clear; your goal is just. You have my full confidence, and you will have every tool you need to carry out your duty.\\nI recently received a touching letter that says a lot about the state of America in these difficult times, a letter from a fourth-grade girl with a father in the military: \"As much as I don\\'t want my dad to fight,\" she wrote, \"I\\'m willing to give him to you.\" This is a precious gift. The greatest she could give. This young girl knows what America is all about. Since September 11, an entire generation of young Americans has gained new understanding of the value of freedom and its cost and duty and its sacrifice.\\nThe battle is now joined on many fronts. We will not waiver, we will not tire, we will not falter, and we will not fail. Peace and freedom will prevail.\\nThank you. May God continue to bless America./nPlease be seated.  President and Senator Clinton, thank you all for being here.  We have come here to pay our respects to 125 men and women who died in the service of America.  We also remember 64 passengers on a hijacked plane; those men and women, boys and girls who fell into the hands of evildoers, and also died here exactly one month ago.\\nOn September 11th, great sorrow came to our country.  And from that sorrow has come great resolve.  Today, we are a nation awakened to the evil of terrorism, and determined to destroy it.  That work began the moment we were attacked; and it will continue until justice is delivered.\\nAmericans are returning, as we must, to the normal pursuits of life.  Americans are returning, as we must, to the normal pursuits of life.  But we know that if you lost a son or daughter here, or a husband, or a wife, or a mom or dad, life will never again be as it was.  The loss was sudden, and hard, and permanent.  So difficult to explain.  So difficult to accept.\\nThree schoolchildren traveling with their teacher.  An Army general. A budget analyst who reported to work here for 30 years.  A lieutenant commander in the Naval Reserve who left behind a wife, a four-year-old son, and another child on the way.\\nOne life touches so many others.  One death can leave sorrow that seems almost unbearable.  But to all of you who lost someone here, I want to say:  You are not alone.  The American people will never forget the cruelty that was done here and in New York, and in the sky over Pennsylvania.\\nWe will never forget all the innocent people killed by the hatred of a few.  We know the loneliness you feel in your loss.  The entire nation, the entire nation shares in your sadness.  And we pray for you and your loved ones.  And we will always honor their memory.\\nThe hijackers were instruments of evil who died in vain.  Behind them is a cult of evil which seeks to harm the innocent and thrives on human suffering.  Theirs is the worst kind of cruelty, the cruelty that is fed, not weakened, by tears.  Theirs is the worst kind of violence, pure malice, while daring to claim the authority of God.  We cannot fully understand the designs and power of evil.  It is enough to know that evil, like goodness, exists.  And in the terrorists, evil has found a willing servant.\\nIn New York, the terrorists chose as their target a symbol of America\\'s freedom and confidence.  Here, they struck a symbol of our strength in the world.  And the attack on the Pentagon, on that day, was more symbolic than they knew.  It was on another September 11th -- September 11th, 1941 -- that construction on this building first began. America was just then awakening to another menace:  The Nazi terror in Europe.\\nAnd on that very night, President Franklin Roosevelt spoke to the nation.  \"The danger,\" he warned, \"has long ceased to be a mere possibility. The danger is here now -- not only from a military enemy, but from an enemy of all law, all liberty, all morality, all religion.\"1\\nFor us too, in the year 2001, an enemy has emerged that rejects every limit of law, morality, and religion.  The terrorists have no true home in any country, or culture, or faith.  They dwell in dark corners of earth. And there, we will find them.\\nThis week, I have called -- This week, I have called the Armed Forces into action.  One by one, we are eliminating power centers of a regime that harbors al Qaeda terrorists.  We gave that regime a choice: Turn over the terrorists, or face your ruin.  They chose unwisely.\\nThe Taliban regime has brought nothing but fear and misery to the people of Afghanistan.  These rulers call themselves holy men, even with their record of drawing money from heroin trafficking.  They consider themselves pious and devout, while subjecting women to fierce brutality.\\nThe Taliban has allied itself with murderers and gave them shelter. But today, for al Qaeda and the Taliban, there is no shelter.  As Americans did 60 years ago, we have entered a struggle of uncertain duration.  But now, as then, we can be certain of the outcome, because we have a number of decisive assets.\\nWe have a unified country.  We have the patience to fight and win on many fronts:  Blocking terrorist plans, seizing their funds, arresting their networks, disrupting their communications, opposing their sponsors. And we have one more great asset in this cause:  The brave men and women of the United States military.\\nFrom my first days in this office, I have felt and seen the strong spirit of the Armed Forces.\\nI saw it at Fort Stewart, Georgia, when I first reviewed our troops as Commander-in-Chief, and looked into the faces of proud and determined soldiers.\\nI saw it in Annapolis on a graduation day; at Camp Pendleton in California; Camp Bondsteel in Kosovo.\\nAnd I have seen this spirit at the Pentagon, before and after the attack on this building.\\nYou\\'ve responded to a great emergency with calm and courage.  And for that, your country honors you.  A Commander-in-Chief must know -- must know -- that he can count on the skill and readiness of servicemen and women at every point in the chain of command.  You have given me that confidence.\\nAnd I give you these commitments.  The wound to this building will not be forgotten, but it will be repaired.  Brick by brick, we will quickly rebuild the Pentagon.  In the missions ahead for the military, you will have everything you need, every resource, every weapon, every means to assure full victory for the United States and the cause of freedom.\\nAnd I pledge to you that America will never relent on this war against terror.  There will be times of swift, dramatic action.  There will be times of steady, quiet progress.  Over time, with patience, and precision, the terrorists will be pursued.  They will be isolated, surrounded, cornered, until there is no place to run, or hide, or rest.\\nAs military and civilian personnel in the Pentagon, you are an important part of the struggle we have entered.  You know the risks of your calling, and you have willingly accepted them.  You believe in our country, and our country believes in you.\\nWithin sight of this building is Arlington [National] Cemetery, the final resting place of many thousands who died for our country over the generations. Enemies of America have now added to these graves, and they wish to add more.  Unlike our enemies, we value every life, and we mourn every loss.\\nYet we\\'re not afraid.  Our cause is just, and worthy of sacrifice. Our nation is strong of heart, firm of purpose.  Inspired by all the courage that has come before, we will meet our moment and we will prevail.\\nMay God bless you all, and may God bless America./nGood evening.  I would like to report to the American people on the state of our war against terror, and then I\\'ll be happy to take questions from the White House press corps.\\nOne month ago today, innocent citizens from more than 80 nations were attacked and killed, without warning or provocation, in an act that horrified not only every American, but every person of every faith, and every nation that values human life.\\nThe attack took place on American soil, but it was an attack on the heart and soul of the civilized world.  And the world has come together to fight a new and different war, the first, and we hope the only one, of the 21st century.  A war against all those who seek to export terror, and a war against those governments that support or shelter them.\\nWe\\'ve accomplished a great deal in one month.  Our staunch friends, Great Britain, our neighbors Canada and Mexico, our NATO allies, our allies in Asia, Russia and nations from every continent on the Earth have offered help of one kind or another -- from military assistance to intelligence information, to crack down on terrorists\\' financial networks.  This week, 56 Islamic nations issued a statement strongly condemning the savage acts of terror, and emphasizing that those acts contradict the peaceful teachings of Islam.\\nAll is strong and united on the diplomatic front.  The men and women of the United States military are doing their duty with skill and success. We have ruined terrorist training camps, disrupted their communications, weakened the Taliban military, and destroyed most of their air defenses.\\nWe\\'re mounting a sustained campaign to drive the terrorists out of their hidden caves and to bring them to justice.  All missions are being executed according to plan on the military front.  At the same time, we are showing the compassion of America by delivering food and medicine to the Afghan people who are, themselves, the victims of a repressive regime.\\nOn the law enforcement front, terrorists are being swept up in an international dragnet.  Several hundred have been arrested.  Thousands of FBI agents are on the trail of other suspects here and abroad.  Working with countries around the world, we have frozen more than $24 million in al Qaeda or Taliban assets.\\nWe are aggressively pursuing the agents of terror around the world, and we are aggressively strengthening our protections here at home.  This week we established America\\'s new Office of Homeland Security, directed by former Governor Tom Ridge.  Americans tonight can know that while the threat is ongoing, we are taking every possible step to protect our country from danger.\\nYour government is doing everything we can to recover from these attacks, and to try to prevent others.  We\\'re acting to make planes and airports safer, rebuild New York and the Pentagon.  We must act to stimulate a slow economy, to help laid-off workers.  And we must fund our military.\\nThis is a time of testing -- this time of testing has revealed the true character of the American people.  We\\'re angry at the evil that was done to us, yet patient and just in our response.\\nBefore September 11th, my Administration was planning an initiative called Communities of Character.  It was designed to help parents develop good character in our children, and to strengthen a spirit of citizenship and service in our communities.  The acts of September 11th have prompted that initiative to occur on its own, in ways far greater than I could have ever imagined.  We\\'ve shown great love for our country, and great tolerance and respect for all our countrymen.\\nI was struck by this:  that in many cities, when Christian and Jewish women learn that Muslim women -- women of cover -- were afraid of going out of their homes alone, that they went shopping with them, that they showed true friendship and support -- an act that shows the world the true nature of America.\\nOur war on terrorism has nothing to do with differences in faith.  It has everything to do with people of all faiths coming together to condemn hate and evil and murder and prejudice.\\nOne month after great suffering and sorrow, America is strong and determined and generous.  I\\'m honored to lead such a country, and I know we are ready for the challenges ahead.\\n/nGood morning and welcome to the White House.  Today, we take an essential step in defeating terrorism, while protecting the constitutional rights of all Americans.  With my signature, this law will give intelligence and law enforcement officials important new tools to fight a present danger.\\nI commend the House and Senate for the hard work they put into this legislation.  Members of Congress and their staffs spent long nights and weekends to get this important bill to my desk.  I appreciate their efforts, and bipartisanship, in passing this new law.\\nI want to thank the Vice President and his staff for working hard to make sure this law was passed.  I want to thank the Secretary of State and the Secretary of Treasury for being here, both of whom lead important parts of our war against terrorism.  I want to thank Attorney General John Ashcroft for spending a lot of time on the Hill to make the case for a balanced piece of legislation.  I want to thank the Director of the FBI and the Director of the CIA for waging an incredibly important part on the two-front war -- one overseas, and a front here at home.\\nI want to thank Governor Tom Ridge for his leadership.  I want to thank the members of Congress who are here on the stage, the Leaders, on this impressive effort.  Senator Hatch and Senator Leahy and Senator Sarbanes and Senator Graham and Senator Reid.\\nI also want to thank Representative Porter Goss, LaFalce, Oxley, and Sensenbrenner for their hard work.  And I want to welcome the men and women of law enforcement who are here in the White House with us today, as well.\\nThe changes, effective today, will help counter a threat like no other our nation has ever faced.  We\\'ve seen the enemy, and the murder of thousands of innocent, unsuspecting people.  They recognize no barrier of morality.  They have no conscience.  The terrorists cannot be reasoned with.  Witness the recent anthrax attacks through our Postal Service.\\nOur country is grateful for the courage the Postal Service has shown during these difficult times.  We mourn the loss of the lives of Thomas Morris and Joseph Curseen; postal workers who died in the line of duty. And our prayers go to their loved ones.\\nI want to assure postal workers that our government is testing more than 200 postal facilities along the entire Eastern corridor that may have been impacted.  And we will move quickly to treat and protect workers where positive exposures are found.\\nBut one thing is for certain:  These terrorists must be pursued, they must be defeated, and they must be brought to justice.  And that is the purpose of this legislation.  Since the 11th of September, the men and women of our intelligence and law enforcement agencies have been relentless in their response to new and sudden challenges.\\nWe have seen the horrors terrorists can inflict.  We may never know what horrors our country was spared by the diligent and determined work of our police forces, the FBI, ATF agents, federal marshals, Custom officers, Secret Service, intelligence professionals and local law enforcement officials, under the most trying conditions.  They are serving this country with excellence, and often with bravery.\\nThey deserve our full support and every means of help that we can provide.  We\\'re dealing with terrorists who operate by highly sophisticated methods and technologies, some of which were not even available when our existing laws were written.  The bill before me takes account of the new realities and dangers posed by modern terrorists.  It will help law enforcement to identify, to dismantle, to disrupt, and to punish terrorists before they strike.\\nFor example, this legislation gives law enforcement officials better tools to put an end to financial counterfeiting, smuggling and money-laundering.  Secondly, it gives intelligence operations and criminal operations the chance to operate not on separate tracks, but to share vital information so necessary to disrupt a terrorist attack before it occurs.\\nAs of today, we\\'re changing the laws governing information-sharing. And as importantly, we\\'re changing the culture of our various agencies that fight terrorism.  Countering and investigating terrorist activity is the number one priority for both law enforcement and intelligence agencies.\\nSurveillance of communications is another essential tool to pursue and stop terrorists.  The existing law was written in the era of rotary telephones.  This new law that I sign today will allow surveillance of all communications used by terrorists, including e-mails, the Internet, and cell phones.\\nAs of today, we\\'ll be able to better meet the technological challenges posed by this proliferation of communications technology.  Investigations are often slowed by limit on the reach of federal search warrants.\\nLaw enforcement agencies have to get a new warrant for each new district they investigate, even when they\\'re after the same suspect.  Under this new law, warrants are valid across all districts and across all states.  And, finally, the new legislation greatly enhances the penalties that will fall on terrorists or anyone who helps them.\\nCurrent statutes deal more severely with drug-traffickers than with terrorists.  That changes today.  We are enacting new and harsh penalties for possession of biological weapons.  We\\'re making it easier to seize the assets of groups and individuals involved in terrorism. The government will have wider latitude in deporting known terrorists and their supporters. The statute of limitations on terrorist acts will be lengthened, as will prison sentences for terrorists.\\nThis bill was carefully drafted and considered.  Led by the members of Congress on this stage, and those seated in the audience, it was crafted with skill and care, determination and a spirit of bipartisanship for which the entire nation is grateful.  This bill met with an overwhelming -- overwhelming agreement in Congress, because it upholds and respects the civil liberties guaranteed by our Constitution.\\nThis legislation is essential not only to pursuing and punishing terrorists, but also preventing more atrocities in the hands of the evil ones.  This government will enforce this law with all the urgency of a nation at war.  The elected branches of our government, and both political parties, are united in our resolve to fight and stop and punish those who would do harm to the American people.\\nIt is now my honor to sign into law the USA Patriot Act of 2001. /nThank you.  Mr. Secretary General, Mr. President, distinguished delegates, and ladies and gentlemen:\\nWe meet in a hall devoted to peace, in a city scarred by violence, in a nation awakened to danger, in a world uniting for a long struggle.  Every civilized nation here today is resolved to keep the most basic commitment of civilization: We will defend ourselves and our future against terror and lawless violence.\\nThe United Nations was founded in this cause.  In a second world war, we learned there is no isolation from evil.  We affirmed that some crimes are so terrible they offend humanity, itself.  And we resolved that the aggressions and ambitions of the wicked must be opposed early, decisively, and collectively, before they threaten us all.  That evil has returned, and that cause is renewed.\\nA few miles from here, many thousands still lie in a tomb of rubble. Tomorrow, the Secretary General, the President of the General Assembly, and I will visit that site, where the names of every nation and region that lost citizens will be read aloud.  If we were to read the names of every person who died, it would take more than three hours.\\nThose names include a citizen of Gambia, whose wife spent their fourth wedding anniversary, September the 12th, searching in vain for her husband. Those names include a man who supported his wife in Mexico, sending home money every week.  Those names include a young Pakistani who prayed toward Mecca five times a day, and died that day trying to save others.\\nThe suffering of September the 11th was inflicted on people of many faiths and many nations.  All of the victims, including Muslims, were killed with equal indifference and equal satisfaction by the terrorist leaders.  The terrorists are violating the tenets of every religion, including the one they invoke.\\nLast week, the Sheikh of Al-Azhar University, the world\\'s oldest Islamic institution of higher learning, declared that terrorism is a disease, and that Islam prohibits killing innocent civilians.  The terrorists call their cause holy, yet, they fund it with drug dealing; they encourage murder and suicide in the name of a great faith that forbids both.  They dare to ask God\\'s blessing as they set out to kill innocent men, women and children.  But the God of Isaac and Ishmael would never answer such a prayer.  And a murderer is not a martyr; he is just a murderer.\\nTime is passing.  Yet, for the United States of America, there will be no forgetting September the 11th.  We will remember every rescuer who died in honor.  We will remember every family that lives in grief.  We will remember the fire and ash, the last phone calls, the funerals of the children.\\nAnd the people of my country will remember those who have plotted against us.  We are learning their names.  We are coming to know their faces.  There is no corner of the Earth distant or dark enough to protect them.  However long it takes, their hour of justice will come.\\nEvery nation has a stake in this cause.  As we meet, the terrorists are planning more murder -- perhaps in my country, or perhaps in yours. They kill because they aspire to dominate.  They seek to overthrow governments and destabilize entire regions.\\nLast week, anticipating this meeting of the General Assembly, they denounced the United Nations.  They called our Secretary General a criminal and condemned all Arab nations here as traitors to Islam.\\nFew countries meet their exacting standards of brutality and oppression.  Every other country is a potential target.  And all the world faces the most horrifying prospect of all:  These same terrorists are searching for weapons of mass destruction, the tools to turn their hatred into holocaust. They can be expected to use chemical, biological and nuclear weapons the moment they are capable of doing so.  No hint of conscience would prevent it.\\nThis threat cannot be ignored.  This threat cannot be appeased. Civilization, itself, the civilization we share, is threatened.  History will record our response, and judge or justify every nation in this hall.\\nThe civilized world is now responding.  We act to defend ourselves and deliver our children from a future of fear.  We choose the dignity of life over a culture of death.  We choose lawful change and civil disagreement over coercion, subversion, and chaos.  These commitments -- hope and order, law and life -- unite people across cultures and continents.  Upon these commitments depend all peace and progress.  For these commitments, we are determined to fight.\\nThe United Nations has risen to this responsibility.  On the 12th of September, these buildings opened for emergency meetings of the General Assembly and the Security Council.  Before the sun had set, these attacks on the world stood condemned by the world.  And I want to thank you for this strong and principled stand.\\nI also thank the Arab Islamic countries that have condemned terrorist murder.  Many of you have seen the destruction of terror in your own lands. The terrorists are increasingly isolated by their own hatred and extremism. They cannot hide behind Islam.  The authors of mass murder and their allies have no place in any culture, and no home in any faith.\\nThe conspiracies of terror are being answered by an expanding global coalition.  Not every nation will be a part of every action against the enemy.  But every nation in our coalition has duties.  These duties can be demanding, as we in America are learning.  We have already made adjustments in our laws and in our daily lives.  We\\'re taking new measures to investigate terror and to protect against threats.\\nThe leaders of all nations must now carefully consider their responsibilities and their future.  Terrorist groups like al Qaeda depend upon the aid or indifference of governments.  They need the support of a financial infrastructure, and safe havens to train and plan and hide.\\nSome nations want to play their part in the fight against terror, but tell us they lack the means to enforce their laws and control their borders.  We stand ready to help.  Some governments still turn a blind eye to the terrorists, hoping the threat will pass them by.  They are mistaken. And some governments, while pledging to uphold the principles of the U.N., have cast their lot with the terrorists.  They support them and harbor them, and they will find that their welcome guests are parasites that will weaken them, and eventually consume them.\\nFor every regime that sponsors terror, there is a price to be paid. And it will be paid.  The allies of terror are equally guilty of murder and equally accountable to justice.\\nThe Taliban are now learning this lesson -- that regime and the terrorists who support it are now virtually indistinguishable.  Together they promote terror abroad and impose a reign of terror on the Afghan people.  Women are executed in Kabal\\'s soccer stadium.  They can be beaten for wearing socks that are too thin.  Men are jailed for missing prayer meetings.\\nThe United States, supported by many nations, is bringing justice to the terrorists in Afghanistan.  We\\'re making progress against military targets, and that is our objective.  Unlike the enemy, we seek to minimize, not maximize, the loss of innocent life.\\nI\\'m proud of the honorable conduct of the American military.  And my country grieves for all the suffering the Taliban have brought upon Afghanistan, including the terrible burden of war.  The Afghan people do not deserve their present rulers.  Years of Taliban misrule have brought nothing but misery and starvation.   Even before this current crisis, 4 million Afghans depended on food from the United States and other nations, and millions of Afghans were refugees from Taliban oppression.\\nI make this promise to all the victims of that regime:  The Taliban\\'s days of harboring terrorists and dealing in heroin and brutalizing women are drawing to a close.  And when that regime is gone, the people of Afghanistan will say with the rest of the world: good riddance.\\nI can promise, too, that America will join the world in helping the people of Afghanistan rebuild their country.  Many nations, including mine, are sending food and medicine to help Afghans through the winter.  America has air-dropped over 1.3 million packages of rations into Afghanistan. Just this week, we air-lifted 20,000 blankets and over 200 tons of provisions into the region.  We continue to provide humanitarian aid, even while the Taliban tried to steal the food we send.\\nMore help eventually will be needed.  The United States will work closely with the United Nations and development banks to reconstruct Afghanistan after hostilities there have ceased and the Taliban are no longer in control.  And the United States will work with the U.N. to support a post-Taliban government that represents all of the Afghan people.\\nIn this war of terror, each of us must answer for what we have done or what we have left undone.  After tragedy, there is a time for sympathy and condolence.  And my country has been very grateful for both.  The memorials and vigils around the world will not be forgotten.  But the time for sympathy has now passed; the time for action has now arrived.\\nThe most basic obligations in this new conflict have already been defined by the United Nations.  On September the 28th, the Security Council adopted Resolution 1373.  Its requirements are clear:  Every United Nations member has a responsibility to crack down on terrorist financing.  We must pass all necessary laws in our own countries to allow the confiscation of terrorist assets.  We must apply those laws to every financial institution in every nation.\\nWe have a responsibility to share intelligence and coordinate the efforts of law enforcement.  If you know something, tell us.  If we know something, we\\'ll tell you.  And when we find the terrorists, we must work together to bring them to justice.  We have a responsibility to deny any sanctuary, safe haven or transit to terrorists.  Every known terrorist camp must be shut down, its operators apprehended, and evidence of their arrest presented to the United Nations.  We have a responsibility to deny weapons to terrorists and to actively prevent private citizens from providing them.\\nThese obligations are urgent and they are binding on every nation with a place in this chamber.  Many governments are taking these obligations seriously, and my country appreciates it.  Yet, even beyond Resolution 1373, more is required, and more is expected of our coalition against terror.\\nWe\\'re asking for a comprehensive commitment to this fight.  We must unite in opposing all terrorists, not just some of them.  In this world there are good causes and bad causes, and we may disagree on where the line is drawn. Yet, there is no such thing as a good terrorist.  No national aspiration, no remembered wrong can ever justify the deliberate murder of the innocent. Any government that rejects this principle, trying to pick and choose its terrorist friends, will know the consequences.\\nWe must speak the truth about terror.  Let us never tolerate outrageous conspiracy theories concerning the attacks of September the 11th; malicious lies that attempt to shift the blame away from the terrorists, themselves, away from the guilty.  To inflame ethnic hatred is to advance the cause of terror.\\nThe war against terror must not serve as an excuse to persecute ethnic and religious minorities in any country. Innocent people must be allowed to live their own lives, by their own customs, under their own religion. And every nation must have avenues for the peaceful expression of opinion and dissent. When these avenues are closed, the temptation to speak through violence grows.\\nWe must press on with our agenda for peace and prosperity in every land.  My country is pledged to encouraging development and expanding trade.  My country is pledged to investing in education and combating AIDS and other infectious diseases around the world.  Following September 11th, these pledges are even more important.  In our struggle against hateful groups that exploit poverty and despair, we must offer an alternative of opportunity and hope.\\nThe American government also stands by its commitment to a just peace in the Middle East.  We are working toward a day when two states, Israel and Palestine, live peacefully together within secure and recognize borders as called for by the Security Council resolutions.  We will do all in our power to bring both parties back into negotiations.  But peace will only come when all have sworn off, forever, incitement, violence and terror.\\nAnd, finally, this struggle is a defining moment for the United Nations, itself.  And the world needs its principled leadership.  It undermines the credibility of this great institution, for example, when the Commission on Human Rights offers seats to the world\\'s most persistent violators of human rights.  The United Nations depends, above all, on its moral authority -- and that authority must be preserved.\\nThe steps I described will not be easy.  For all nations, they will require effort.  For some nations, they will require great courage.  Yet, the cost of inaction is far greater.  The only alternative to victory is a nightmare world where every city is a potential killing field.\\nAs I\\'ve told the American people, freedom and fear are at war.  We face enemies that hate not our policies, but our existence; the tolerance of openness and creative culture that defines us.  But the outcome of this conflict is certain:  There is a current in history and it runs toward freedom.  Our enemies resent it and dismiss it, but the dreams of mankind are defined by liberty -- the natural right to create and build and worship and live in dignity.  When men and women are released from oppression and isolation, they find fulfillment and hope, and they leave poverty by the millions.\\nThese aspirations are lifting up the peoples of Europe, Asia, Africa and the Americas, and they can lift up all of the Islamic world.\\nWe stand for the permanent hopes of humanity, and those hopes will not be denied.  We\\'re confident, too, that history has an author who fills time and eternity with his purpose.  We know that evil is real, but good will prevail against it.  This is the  teaching of many faiths, and in that assurance we gain strength for a long journey.\\nIt is our task -- the task of this generation -- to provide the response to aggression and terror.  We have no other choice, because there is no other peace.\\nWe did not ask for this mission, yet there is honor in history\\'s call. We have a chance to write the story of our times, a story of courage defeating cruelty and light overcoming darkness.  This calling is worthy of any life, and worthy of every nation.  So let us go forward, confident, determined, and unafraid.\\nThank you very much. /nI\\'m glad to be back here at the Citadel.  \\nI have come to talk about the future security of our country, in a place where I took up this subject two years ago when I was candidate for President.  In September 1999, I said here at the Citadel that America was entering a period of consequences that would be defined by the threat of terror, and that we faced a challenge of military transformation.  That threat has now revealed itself, and that challenge is now the military and moral necessity of our time. So, today, I will set forth the commitments essential to victory in our war against terror.\\nI want to thank Major General John Grinalds for his hospitality.  I want to thank the Citadel Board of Visitors, the staff, and the faculty.  I understand the Governor is here.  And I know my friends, the Lt. Governor, the Speaker and the Attorney General are here, and it was great to have seen them at the airport.  I thank my friend, Adjutant General Stan Spears for being here.\\nI\\'m grateful that Senator Hollings and members of the South Carolina congressional delegation flew down on Air Force One.  I only wish that the senior Senator was on the airplane so I could have wished him a happy 99th birthday.\\nBut most of all, most of all, I want to say how much I appreciate being in the presence of some of America\\'s finest, the South Carolina Corp of Cadets of Citadel.\\nFour days ago, I joined the men and women of the USS Enterprise to mark the 60th anniversary of Pearl Harbor.  December 7th, 1941 was a decisive day that changed our nation forever.  In a single moment, America\\'s \"splendid isolation\" was ended.  And the four years that followed transformed the American way of war.\\nThe age of battleships gave way to the offensive capability of aircraft carriers.  The tank, once used only to protect infantry, now served to cut through enemy lines.  At Guadalcanal, and Normandy, and Iwo Jima, amphibious warfare proved its worth.  And by war\\'s end, no one would ever again doubt the value of strategic air power.\\nEven more importantly, an American President and his successors shaped a world beyond a war.  They rebuilt Europe with the Marshall Plan, formed a great alliance for freedom in NATO, and expressed the hope of collective security in the United Nations.  America took the lead, becoming freedom\\'s defender and assuming responsibilities that only we could bear.\\nSeptember 11th, 2001 -- three months and a long time ago -- set another dividing line in our lives and in the life of our nation.  An illusion of immunity was shattered.  A faraway evil became a present danger.  And a great cause became clear:  We will fight terror and those who sponsor it, to save our children from a future of fear.\\nTo win this war, we have to think differently.  The enemy who appeared on September 11th seeks to evade our strength and constantly searches for our weaknesses.  So America is required once again to change the way our military thinks and fights.  And starting on October 7th, the enemy in Afghanistan got the first glimpses of a new American military that cannot, and will not, be evaded.\\nWhen I committed U.S. forces to this battle, I had every confidence that they would be up to the task.  And they have proven me right.  The Taliban and the terrorists set out to dominate a country and intimidate the world.  Today, from their caves, it\\'s all looking a little different.  And no cave is deep enough to escape the patient justice of the United States of America.\\nWe are also beginning to see the possibilities of a world beyond the war on terror.  We have a chance, if we take it, to write a hopeful chapter in human history.  All at once, a new threat to civilization is erasing old lines of rivalry and resentment between nations.  Russia and America are building a new cooperative relationship.  India and the United States are increasingly aligned across a range of issues, even as we work closely with Pakistan.  Germany and Japan are assuming new military roles, appropriate to their status as great democracies.\\nThe vast majority of countries are now on the same side of a moral and ideological divide.  We\\'re making common cause with every nation that chooses lawful change over chaotic violence -- every nation that values peace and safety and innocent life.\\nStaring across this divide are bands of murderers, supported by outlaw regimes.  They are a movement defined by their hatreds.  They hate progress, and freedom, and choice, and culture, and music, and laughter, and women, and Christians, and Jews, and all Muslims who reject their distorted doctrines.  They love only one thing -- they love power.  And when they have it, they use it without mercy.\\nThe great threat to civilization is not that the terrorists will inspire millions.  Only the terrorists themselves would want to live in their brutal and joyless world.  The great threat to civilization is that a few evil men will multiply their murders, and gain the means to kill on a scale equal to their hatred.  We know they have this mad intent, and we\\'re determined to stop them.\\nOur lives, our way of life, and our every hope for the world depend on a single commitment:  The authors of mass murder must be defeated, and never allowed to gain or use the weapons of mass destruction.\\nAmerica and our friends will meet this threat with every method at our disposal.  We will discover and destroy sleeper cells.  We will track terrorist movements, trace their communications, disrupt their funding, and take their network apart, piece by piece.\\nAbove all, we\\'re acting to end the state sponsorship of terror.  Rogue states are clearly the most likely sources of chemical and biological and nuclear weapons for terrorists.  Every nation now knows that we cannot accept -- and we will not accept -- states that harbor, finance, train, or equip the agents of terror.  Those nations that violate this principle will be regarded as hostile regimes.  They have been warned, they are being watched, and they will be held to account.\\nPreventing mass terror will be the responsibilities of Presidents far into the future.  And this obligation sets three urgent and enduring priorities for America.  The first priority is to speed the transformation of our military.\\nWhen the Cold War ended, some predicted that the era of direct threats to our nation was over.  Some thought our military would be used overseas -- not to win wars, but mainly to police and pacify, to control crowds and contain ethnic conflict.  They were wrong.\\nWhile the threats to America have changed, the need for victory has not.  We are fighting shadowy, entrenched enemies -- enemies using the tools of terror and guerrilla war -- yet we are finding new tactics and new weapons to attack and defeat them.  This revolution in our military is only beginning, and it promises to change the face of battle.\\nAfghanistan has been a proving ground for this new approach.  These past two months have shown that an innovative doctrine and high-tech weaponry can shape and then dominate an unconventional conflict.  The brave men and women of our military are rewriting the rules of war with new technologies and old values like courage and honor.  And they have made this nation proud.\\nOur commanders are gaining a real-time picture of the entire battlefield, and are able to get targeting information from sensor to shooter almost instantly.  Our intelligence professionals and special forces have cooperated in battle-friendly -- with battle-friendly Afghan forces -- fighters who know the terrain, who know the Taliban, and who understand the local culture.  And our special forces have the technology to call in precision air strikes -- along with the flexibility to direct those strikes from horseback, in the first cavalry charge of the 21st century.\\nThis combination -- real-time intelligence, local allied forces, special forces, and precision air power -- has really never been used before.  The conflict in Afghanistan has taught us more about the future of our military than a decade of blue ribbon panels and think-tank symposiums.\\nThe Predator is a good example.  This unmanned aerial vehicle is able to circle over enemy forces, gather intelligence, transmit information instantly back to commanders, then fire on targets with extreme accuracy.\\nBefore the war, the Predator had skeptics, because it did not fit the old ways.  Now it is clear the military does not have enough unmanned vehicles.  We\\'re entering an era in which unmanned vehicles of all kinds will take on greater importance -- in space, on land, in the air, and at sea.\\nPrecision-guided munitions also offer great promise.  In the Gulf War, these weapons were the exception -- while in Afghanistan, they have been the majority of the munitions we have used.  We\\'re striking with greater effectiveness, at greater range, with fewer civilian casualties.  More and more, our weapons can hit moving targets.  When all of our military can continuously locate and track moving targets -- with surveillance from air and space -- warfare will be truly revolutionized.\\nThe need for military transformation was clear before the conflict in Afghanistan, and before September the 11th.  Here at the Citadel in 1999, I spoke of keeping the peace by redefining war on our terms.  The same recommendation was made in the strategic review that Secretary Rumsfeld briefed me on last August -- a review that I fully endorse.  What\\'s different today is our sense of urgency -- the need to build this future force while fighting a present war.  It\\'s like overhauling an engine while you\\'re going at 80 miles an hour.  Yet we have no other choice.\\nOur military has a new and essential mission.  For states that support terror, it\\'s not enough that the consequences be costly -- they must be devastating.  The more credible this reality, the more likely that regimes will change their behavior -- making it less likely that America and our friends will need to use overwhelming force against them.\\nTo build our future force, the Armed Services must continue to attract America\\'s best people, with good pay and good living conditions.  Our military culture must reward new thinking, innovation, and experimentation.  Congress must give defense leaders the freedom to innovate, instead of micromanaging the Defense Department.  And every service and every constituency of our military must be willing to sacrifice some of their own pet projects.  Our war on terror cannot be used to justify obsolete bases, obsolete programs, or obsolete weapon systems.  Every dollar of defense spending must meet a single test:  It must help us build the decisive power we will need to win the wars of the future.\\nOur country is united in supporting a great cause -- and in supporting those who fight for it.  We will give our men and women in uniform every resource, every weapon, every tool they need to win the long battle that lies ahead.\\nAmerica\\'s next priority to prevent mass terror is to protect against the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction and the means to deliver them.  I wish I could report to the American people that this threat does not exist -- that our enemy is content with car bombs and box cutters -- but I cannot.\\nOne former al Qaeda member has testified in court that he was involved in an effort 10 years ago to obtain nuclear materials.  And the leader of al Qaeda calls that effort \"a religious duty.\"  Abandoned al Qaeda houses in Kabul contained diagrams for crude weapons of mass destruction.  And as we all know, terrorists have put anthrax into the U.S. mail, and used sarin gas in a Tokyo subway.\\nAnd almost every state that actively sponsors terror is known to be seeking weapons of mass destruction and the missiles to deliver them at longer and longer ranges.  Their hope is to blackmail the United States into abandoning our war on terror, and forsaking our friends and allies and security commitments around the world.  Our enemies are bound for disappointment.  America will never be blackmailed, and we will never forsake our commitment to liberty.\\nTo meet our new threats, I have directed my National Security Advisor and my Homeland Security Director to develop a comprehensive strategy on proliferation.  Working with other countries, we will strengthen nonproliferation treaties and toughen export controls.  Together, we must keep the world\\'s most dangerous technologies out of the hands of the world\\'s most dangerous people.\\nA crucial partner in this effort is Russia -- a nation we are helping to dismantle strategic weapons, reduce nuclear material, and increase security at nuclear sites.  Our two countries will expand efforts to provide peaceful employment for scientists who formerly worked in Soviet weapons facilities.  The United States will also work with Russia to build a facility to destroy tons of nerve agent.  I\\'ll request an over-all increase in funding to support this vital mission.\\nEven as we fight to prevent proliferation, we must prepare for every possibility.  At home, we must be better prepared to detect, protect against, and respond to the potential use of weapons of mass destruction.  Abroad, our military forces must have the ability to fight and win against enemies who would use such weapons against us.\\nBiodefense has become a major initiative of ours.  This year we\\'ve already requested nearly $3 billion additional dollars for biodefense, more than doubling the level of funding prior to September the 11th.\\nThe attacks on our nation made it even more clear that we need to build limited and effective defenses against a missile attack.  Our enemies seek every chance and every means to do harm to our country, our forces, and our friends.  And we will not permit it.\\nSuppose the Taliban and the terrorists had been able to strike America or important allies with a ballistic missile.  Our coalition would have become fragile, the stakes in our war much, much higher.  We must protect Americans and our friends against all forms of terror, including the terror that could arrive on a missile.\\nLast week we conducted another promising test of our missile defense technology.  For the good of peace, we\\'re moving forward with an active program to determine what works and what does not work.  In order to do so, we must move beyond the 1972 Anti-Ballistic Missile Treaty, a treaty that was written in a different era, for a different enemy.\\nAmerica and our allies must not be bound to the past.  We must be able to build the defenses we need against the enemies of the 21st century.\\nOur third and final priority in the fight against mass terror is to strengthen the advantage that good intelligence gives our country.  Every day I make decisions influenced by the intelligence briefing of that morning.  To reach decisions, a President needs more than data and information.  A President needs real and current knowledge and analysis of the plans, intentions, and capabilities of our enemies.\\nThe last several months have shown that there is no substitute for good intelligence officers, people on the ground.  These are the people who find the targets, follow our enemies, and help us disrupt their evil plans.\\nThe United States must rebuild our network of human intelligence.  And we will apply the best new technology to gather intelligence on the new threats.  Sophisticated systems like Global Hawk, an unmanned surveillance plane, are transforming our intelligence capabilities.  Our technological strengths produce great advantages, and we will build on them.\\nOur intelligence services and federal law enforcement agencies must work more closely together, and share timely information with our state and local authorities.  The more we know, the more terrorist plans we can prevent and disrupt, and the better we\\'ll be able to protect the American people.\\nAnd in all they do, our intelligence agencies must attract the best people -- the best collectors, the best analysts, the best linguists.  We will give them the training they need and the compensation they deserve.\\nThere have been times here in America when our intelligence services were held in suspicion, and even contempt.  Now, when we face this new war, we know how much we need them.  And for their dedication and for their service, America is grateful.\\nWe\\'re also grateful to you, the students of the Citadel.  Your uniforms symbolize a tradition of honor and sacrifice, renewed in your own lives.  Many of you will enter our military -- taking your place in the war against terror.  That struggle may continue for many years, and it may bring great costs.  But you will have chosen a great calling at a crucial hour for our nation.\\nThe course we follow is a matter of profound consequence to many nations.  If America wavers, the world will lose heart.  If America leads, the world will show its courage.  America will never waver.  America will lead the world to peace.\\nOur cause is necessary.  Our cause is just.  And no matter how long it takes, we will defeat the enemies of freedom.\\nIn all that is to come, I know the graduates of the Citadel will bring credit to America, to the military, and to this great institution.  In the words of your school song, you will go where you\\'ve always gone -- \"in the Paths our fathers showed us...Peace and Honor, God and Country, We will fight for thee.\"\\nGod bless./nA great writer has said that the struggle of humanity against tyranny is the struggle of memory against forgetting. When we fight terror, we fight tyranny; and so we remember. We remember the perfect blueness of the sky that Tuesday morning. We remember the children traveling without their mothers when their planes were hijacked.\\nWe remember the cruelty of the murderers and the pain and anguish of the murdered. Every one of the innocents who died on September the 11th was the most important person on earth to somebody. Every death extinguished a world.\\nWe remember the courage of the rescue workers and the outpouring of friendship and sympathy from nations around the world. We remember how we felt that day: our sadness, the surge of love for our country, our anger, and our determination to right this huge wrong.\\nToday, the wrong is being righted and justice is being done. We still have far to go. And many dangers lie ahead. Yet, there can be no doubt how this conflict will end. Our enemies have made the mistake that America\\'s enemies always make. They saw liberty and thought they saw weakness. And now, they see defeat.\\nIn time, this war will end. But our remembrance never will. All around this beautiful city are statues of our heroes, memorials, museums and archives that preserve our national experience, our achievements and our failures, our defeats and our victories.\\nThis republic is young, but its memory is long. Now, we have inscribed a new memory alongside those others. It\\'s a memory of tragedy and shock, of loss and mourning. But not only of loss and mourning. It\\'s also a memory of bravery and self-sacrifice, and the love that lays down its life for a friend -- even a friend whose name it never knew.\\nWe are privileged to have with us the families of many of the heroes on September the 11th, including the family of Jeremy Glick of Flight 93. His courage and self-sacrifice may have saved the White House. It is right and fitting that it is here we pay our respects.\\nIn time, perhaps, we will mark the memory of September the 11th in stone and metal -- something we can show children as yet unborn to help them understand what happened on this minute and on this day.\\nBut for those of us who lived through these events, the only marker we\\'ll ever need is the tick of a clock at the 46th minute of the eighth hour of the 11th day. We will remember where we were and how we felt. We will remember the dead and what we owe them. We will remember what we lost and what we found.\\nAnd in our time, we will honor the memory of the 11th day by doing our duty as citizens of this great country, freedom\\'s home and freedoms defender.\\nGod bless. /nThank you very much.\\nMr. Speaker, Vice President Cheney, members of Congress, distinguished guests, fellow citizens: As we gather tonight, our nation is at war, our economy is in recession, and the civilized world faces unprecedented dangers. Yet the state of our Union has never been stronger.\\nWe last met in an hour of shock and suffering.  In four short months, our nation has comforted the victims, begun to rebuild New York and the Pentagon, rallied a great coalition, captured, arrested, and rid the world of thousands of terrorists, destroyed Afghanistan\\'s terrorist training camps, saved a people from starvation, and freed a country from brutal oppression.\\nThe American flag flies again over our embassy in Kabul. Terrorists who once occupied Afghanistan now occupy cells at Guantanamo Bay. And terrorist leaders who urged followers to sacrifice their lives are running for their own.\\nAmerica and Afghanistan are now allies against terror. We\\'ll be partners in rebuilding that country. And this evening we welcome the distinguished interim leader of a liberated Afghanistan: Chairman Hamid Karzai.\\nThe last time we met in this chamber, the mothers and daughters of Afghanistan were captives in their own homes, forbidden from working or going to school.  Today women are free, and are part of Afghanistan\\'s new government.  And we welcome the new Minister of Women\\'s Affairs, Doctor Sima Samar.\\nOur progress is a tribute to the spirit of the Afghan people, to the resolve of our coalition, and to the might of the United States military. When I called our troops into action, I did so with complete confidence in their courage and skill. And tonight, thanks to them, we are winning the war on terror. The man and women of our Armed Forces have delivered a message now clear to every enemy of the United States:  Even 7,000 miles away, across oceans and continents, on mountaintops and in caves -- you will not escape the justice of this nation.\\nFor many Americans, these four months have brought sorrow, and pain that will never completely go away. Every day a retired firefighter returns to Ground Zero, to feel closer to his two sons who died there. At a memorial in New York, a little boy left his football with a note for his lost father: Dear Daddy, please take this to heaven. I don\\'t want to play football until I can play with you again some day.\\nLast month, at the grave of her husband, Michael, a CIA officer and Marine who died in Mazur-e-Sharif, Shannon Spann said these words of farewell: \"Semper Fi, my love.\" Shannon is with us tonight.\\nShannon, I assure you and all who have lost a loved one that our cause is just, and our country will never forget the debt we owe Michael and all who gave their lives for freedom.\\nOur cause is just, and it continues. Our discoveries in Afghanistan confirmed our worst fears, and showed us the true scope of the task ahead. We have seen the depth of our enemies\\' hatred in videos, where they laugh about the loss of innocent life. And the depth of their hatred is equaled by the madness of the destruction they design. We have found diagrams of American nuclear power plants and public water facilities, detailed instructions for making chemical weapons, surveillance maps of American cities, and thorough descriptions of landmarks in America and throughout the world.\\nWhat we have found in Afghanistan confirms that, far from ending there, our war against terror is only beginning. Most of the 19 men who hijacked planes on September the 11th were trained in Afghanistan\\'s camps, and so were tens of thousands of others. Thousands of dangerous killers, schooled in the methods of murder, often supported by outlaw regimes, are now spread throughout the world like ticking time bombs, set to go off without warning.\\nThanks to the work of our law enforcement officials and coalition partners, hundreds of terrorists have been arrested. Yet, tens of thousands of trained terrorists are still at large. These enemies view the entire world as a battlefield, and we must pursue them wherever they are. So long as training camps operate, so long as nations harbor terrorists, freedom is at risk. And America and our allies must not, and will not, allow it.\\nOur nation will continue to be steadfast and patient and persistent in the pursuit of two great objectives. First, we will shut down terrorist camps, disrupt terrorist plans, and bring terrorists to justice. And, second, we must prevent the terrorists and regimes who seek chemical, biological or nuclear weapons from threatening the United States and the world.\\nOur military has put the terror training camps of Afghanistan out of business, yet camps still exist in at least a dozen countries. A terrorist underworld -- including groups like Hamas, Hezbollah, Islamic Jihad, Jaish-i-Mohammed -- operates in remote jungles and deserts, and hides in the centers of large cities.\\nWhile the most visible military action is in Afghanistan, America is acting elsewhere. We now have troops in the Philippines, helping to train that country\\'s armed forces to go after terrorist cells that have executed an American, and still hold hostages. Our soldiers, working with the Bosnian government, seized terrorists who were plotting to bomb our embassy. Our Navy is patrolling the coast of Africa to block the shipment of weapons and the establishment of terrorist camps in Somalia.\\nMy hope is that all nations will heed our call, and eliminate the terrorist parasites who threaten their countries and our own.  Many nations are acting forcefully. Pakistan is now cracking down on terror, and I admire the strong leadership of President Musharraf.\\nBut some governments will be timid in the face of terror. And make no mistake about it: If they do not act, America will.\\nOur second goal is to prevent regimes that sponsor terror from threatening America or our friends and allies with weapons of mass destruction. Some of these regimes have been pretty quiet since September the 11th. But we know their true nature. North Korea is a regime arming with missiles and weapons of mass destruction, while starving its citizens.\\nIran aggressively pursues these weapons and exports terror, while an unelected few repress the Iranian people\\'s hope for freedom.\\nIraq continues to flaunt its hostility toward America and to support terror. The Iraqi regime has plotted to develop anthrax, and nerve gas, and nuclear weapons for over a decade. This is a regime that has already used poison gas to murder thousands of its own citizens -- leaving the bodies of mothers huddled over their dead children. This is a regime that agreed to international inspections -- then kicked out the inspectors. This is a regime that has something to hide from the civilized world.\\nStates like these, and their terrorist allies, constitute an axis of evil, arming to threaten the peace of the world. By seeking weapons of mass destruction, these regimes pose a grave and growing danger. They could provide these arms to terrorists, giving them the means to match their hatred. They could attack our allies or attempt to blackmail the United States. In any of these cases, the price of indifference would be catastrophic.\\nWe will work closely with our coalition to deny terrorists and their state sponsors the materials, technology, and expertise to make and deliver weapons of mass destruction. We will develop and deploy effective missile defenses to protect America and our allies from sudden attack. And all nations should know: America will do what is necessary to ensure our nation\\'s security.\\nWe\\'ll be deliberate, yet time is not on our side. I will not wait on events, while dangers gather.  I will not stand by, as peril draws closer and closer. The United States of America will not permit the world\\'s most dangerous regimes to threaten us with the world\\'s most destructive weapons. \\nOur War on terror is well begun, but it is only begun. This campaign may not be finished on our watch -- yet it must be and it will be waged on our watch.\\nWe can\\'t stop short. If we stop now -- leaving terror camps intact and terror states unchecked -- our sense of security would be false and temporary. History has called America and our allies to action, and it is both our responsibility and our privilege to fight freedom\\'s fight.\\nOur first priority must always be the security of our nation, and that will be reflected in the budget I send to Congress. My budget supports three great goals for America: We will win this war; we\\'ll protect our homeland; and we will revive our economy.\\nSeptember the 11th brought out the best in America, and the best in this Congress. And I join the American people in applauding your unity and resolve. Now Americans deserve to have this same spirit directed toward addressing problems here at home. I\\'m a proud member of my party -- yet as we act to win the war, protect our people, and create jobs in America, we must act, first and foremost, not as Republicans, not as Democrats, but as Americans.\\nIt costs a lot to fight this war.  We have spent more than a billion dollars a month -- over $30 million a day -- and we must be prepared for future operations. Afghanistan proved that expensive precision weapons defeat the enemy and spare innocent lives, and we need more of them. We need to replace aging aircraft and make our military more agile, to put our troops anywhere in the world quickly and safely. Our men and women in uniform deserve the best weapons, the best equipment, the best training -- and they also deserve another pay raise.\\nMy budget includes the largest increase in defense spending in two decades -- because while the price of freedom and security is high, it is never too high. Whatever it costs to defend our country, we will pay.\\nThe next priority of my budget is to do everything possible to protect our citizens and strengthen our nation against the ongoing threat of another attack. Time and distance from the events of September the 11th will not make us safer unless we act on its lessons. America is no longer protected by vast oceans. We are protected from attack only by vigorous action abroad, and increased vigilance at home.\\nMy budget nearly doubles funding for a sustained strategy of homeland security, focused on four key areas: bioterrorism, emergency response, airport and border security, and improved intelligence.  We will develop vaccines to fight anthrax and other deadly diseases. We\\'ll increase funding to help states and communities train and equip our heroic police and firefighters. We will improve intelligence collection and sharing, expand patrols at our borders, strengthen the security of air travel, and use technology to track the arrivals and departures of visitors to the United States.\\nHomeland security will make America not only stronger, but, in many ways, better. Knowledge gained from bioterrorism research will improve public health. Stronger police and fire departments will mean safer neighborhoods. Stricter border enforcement will help combat illegal drugs. And as government works to better secure our homeland, America will continue to depend on the eyes and ears of alert citizens.\\nA few days before Christmas, an airline flight attendant spotted a passenger lighting a match. The crew and passengers quickly subdued the man, who had been trained by al Qaeda and was armed with explosives. The people on that plane were alert and, as a result, likely saved nearly 200 lives.  And tonight we welcome and thank flight attendants Hermis Moutardier and Christina Jones. \\nOnce we have funded our national security and our homeland security, the final great priority of my budget is economic security for the American people. To achieve these great national objectives -- to win the war, protect the homeland, and revitalize our economy -- our budget will run a deficit that will be small and short-term, so long as Congress restrains spending and acts in a fiscally responsible manner. We have clear priorities and we must act at home with the same purpose and resolve we have shown overseas: We\\'ll prevail in the war, and we will defeat this recession.\\nAmericans who have lost their jobs need our help and I support extending unemployment benefits and direct assistance for health care coverage. Yet, American workers want more than unemployment checks -- they want a steady paycheck. When America works, America prospers, so my economic security plan can be summed up in one word:  jobs.\\nGood jobs begin with good schools, and here we\\'ve made a fine start. Republicans and Democrats worked together to achieve historic education reform so that no child is left behind. I was proud to work with members of both parties: Chairman John Boehner and Congressman George Miller. Senator Judd Gregg. And I was so proud of our work, I even had nice things to say about my friend, Ted Kennedy. I know the folks at the Crawford coffee shop couldn\\'t believe I\\'d say such a thing -- but our work on this bill shows what is possible if we set aside posturing and focus on results.\\nThere is more to do. We need to prepare our children to read and succeed in school with improved Head Start and early childhood development programs. We must upgrade our teacher colleges and teacher training and launch a major recruiting drive with a great goal for America: a quality teacher in every classroom.\\nGood jobs also depend on reliable and affordable energy. This Congress must act to encourage conservation, promote technology, build infrastructure, and it must act to increase energy production at home so America is less dependent on foreign oil.\\nGood jobs depend on expanded trade. Selling into new markets creates new jobs, so I ask Congress to finally approve trade promotion authority. On these two key issues, trade and energy, the House of Representatives has acted to create jobs, and I urge the Senate to pass this legislation.\\nGood jobs depend on sound tax policy. Last year, some in this hall thought my tax relief plan was too small; some thought it was too big. But when the checks arrived in the mail, most Americans thought tax relief was just about right. Congress listened to the people and responded by reducing tax rates, doubling the child credit, and ending the death tax.  For the sake of long-term growth and to help Americans plan for the future, let\\'s make these tax cuts permanent.\\nThe way out of this recession, the way to create jobs, is to grow the economy by encouraging investment in factories and equipment, and by speeding up tax relief so people have more money to spend. For the sake of American workers, let\\'s pass a stimulus package.\\nGood jobs must be the aim of welfare reform. As we reauthorize these important reforms, we must always remember the goal is to reduce dependency on government and offer every American the dignity of a job.\\nAmericans know economic security can vanish in an instant without health security. I ask Congress to join me this year to enact a patients\\' bill of rights -- to give uninsured workers credits to help buy health coverage -- to approve an historic increase in the spending for veterans\\' health -- and to give seniors a sound and modern Medicare system that includes coverage for prescription drugs.\\nA good job should lead to security in retirement. I ask Congress to enact new safeguards for 401K and pension plans. Employees who have worked hard and saved all their lives should not have to risk losing everything if their company fails. Through stricter accounting standards and tougher disclosure requirements, corporate America must be made more accountable to employees and shareholders and held to the highest standards of conduct.\\nRetirement security also depends upon keeping the commitments of Social Security, and we will.  We must make Social Security financially stable and allow personal retirement accounts for younger workers who choose them.\\nMembers, you and I will work together in the months ahead on other issues:  productive farm policy -- a cleaner environment -- broader home ownership, especially among minorities -- and ways to encourage the good work of charities and faith-based groups. I ask you to join me on these important domestic issues in the same spirit of cooperation we\\'ve applied to our war against terrorism.\\nDuring these last few months, I\\'ve been humbled and privileged to see the true character of this country in a time of testing. Our enemies believed America was weak and materialistic, that we would splinter in fear and selfishness. They were as wrong as they are evil.\\nThe American people have responded magnificently, with courage and compassion, strength and resolve.  As I have met the heroes, hugged the families, and looked into the tired faces of rescuers, I have stood in awe of the American people.\\nAnd I hope you will join me -- I hope you will join me in expressing thanks to one American for the strength and calm and comfort she brings to our nation in crisis, our First Lady, Laura Bush. \\nNone of us would ever wish the evil that was done on September the 11th. Yet after America was attacked, it was as if our entire country looked into a mirror and saw our better selves. We were reminded that we are citizens, with obligations to each other, to our country, and to history. We began to think less of the goods we can accumulate, and more about the good we can do.\\nFor too long our culture has said, \"If it feels good, do it.\" Now America is embracing a new ethic and a new creed: \"Let\\'s roll.\" In the sacrifice of soldiers, the fierce brotherhood of firefighters, and the bravery and generosity of ordinary citizens, we have glimpsed what a new culture of responsibility could look like. We want to be a nation that serves goals larger than self.  We\\'ve been offered a unique opportunity, and we must not let this moment pass.\\nMy call tonight is for every American to commit at least two years -- 4,000 hours over the rest of your lifetime -- to the service of your neighbors and your nation. Many are already serving, and I thank you.  If you aren\\'t sure how to help, I\\'ve got a good place to start. To sustain and extend the best that has emerged in America, I invite you to join the new USA Freedom Corps. The Freedom Corps will focus on three areas of need: responding in case of crisis at home; rebuilding our communities; and extending American compassion throughout the world.\\nOne purpose of the USA Freedom Corps will be homeland security. America needs retired doctors and nurses who can be mobilized in major emergencies; volunteers to help police and fire departments; transportation and utility workers well-trained in spotting danger.\\nOur country also needs citizens working to rebuild our communities. We need mentors to love children, especially children whose parents are in prison.  And we need more talented teachers in troubled schools. USA Freedom Corps will expand and improve the good efforts of AmeriCorps and Senior Corps to recruit more than 200,000 new volunteers.\\nAnd America needs citizens to extend the compassion of our country to every part of the world.  So we will renew the promise of the Peace Corps, double its volunteers over the next five years -- and ask it to join a new effort to encourage development and education and opportunity in the Islamic world.\\nThis time of adversity offers a unique moment of opportunity -- a moment we must seize to change our culture.  Through the gathering momentum of millions of acts of service and decency and kindness, I know we can overcome evil with greater good. And we have a great opportunity during this time of war to lead the world toward the values that will bring lasting peace.\\nAll fathers and mothers, in all societies, want their children to be educated, and live free from poverty and violence. No people on Earth yearn to be oppressed, or aspire to servitude, or eagerly await the midnight knock of the secret police.\\nIf anyone doubts this, let them look to Afghanistan, where the Islamic \"street\" greeted the fall of tyranny with song and celebration. Let the skeptics look to Islam\\'s own rich history, with its centuries of learning, and tolerance and progress. America will lead by defending liberty and justice because they are right and true and unchanging for all people everywhere.\\nNo nation owns these aspirations, and no nation is exempt from them. We have no intention of imposing our culture. But America will always stand firm for the non-negotiable demands of human dignity:  the rule of law; limits on the power of the state; respect for women; private property; free speech; equal justice; and religious tolerance.\\nAmerica will take the side of brave men and women who advocate these values around the world, including the Islamic world, because we have a greater objective than eliminating threats and containing resentment. We seek a just and peaceful world beyond the war on terror.\\nIn this moment of opportunity, a common danger is erasing old rivalries. America is working with Russia and China and India, in ways we have never before, to achieve peace and prosperity.  In every region, free markets and free trade and free societies are proving their power to lift lives.  Together with friends and allies from Europe to Asia, and Africa to Latin America, we will demonstrate that the forces of terror cannot stop the momentum of freedom.\\nThe last time I spoke here, I expressed the hope that life would return to normal. In some ways, it has. In others, it never will.  Those of us who have lived through these challenging times have been changed by them. We\\'ve come to know truths that we will never question: evil is real, and it must be opposed. Beyond all differences of race or creed, we are one country, mourning together and facing danger together. Deep in the American character, there is honor, and it is stronger than cynicism.  And many have discovered again that even in tragedy -- especially in tragedy -- God is near.\\nIn a single instant, we realized that this will be a decisive decade in the history of liberty, that we\\'ve been called to a unique role in human events. Rarely has the world faced a choice more clear or consequential.\\nOur enemies send other people\\'s children on missions of suicide and murder. They embrace tyranny and death as a cause and a creed. We stand for a different choice, made long ago, on the day of our founding. We affirm it again today. We choose freedom and the dignity of every life.\\nSteadfast in our purpose, we now press on. We have known freedom\\'s price. We have shown freedom\\'s power. And in this great conflict, my fellow Americans, we will see freedom\\'s victory.\\nThank you all. May God bless./n'"
