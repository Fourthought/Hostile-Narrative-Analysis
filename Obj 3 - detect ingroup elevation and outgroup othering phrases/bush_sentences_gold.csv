54%,,,,Will you do that now because Russia's cooperation is so important?
54%,,,,"And, separately, but related, are you disappointed that while there have been some statements of support from the Muslim world and the Arab world, that there have not been more vocal and repeated statements agreeing with you that this is a war against terrorism, not Islam?"

54%,,,,I was heartened by the Organization of Islamic Conference's statement of support for our war against terror.1
54%,,,,"I think that that statement spoke volumes about the attitude of Muslim nations, and I was pleased to see that support."
54%,,,,Some coalition members will feel more comfortable doing certain things than other coalition members will.
54%,,,,"And my attitude is, and the attitude of my Administration is, we'll accept any help that a government is comfortable in giving."

55%,,,,And I'm going to ask my friend to envision a world in which a terrorist thug and/or a host nation might have the ability to develop -- to deliver a weapon of mass destruction via a -- via rocket.
55%,,,,And wouldn't it be in our nation's advantage to be able to shoot it down?
55%,,,,"At the very least, it should be in our nation's advantage to determine whether we can shoot it down."
55%,,,,And we're restricted from doing that because of an ABM Treaty that was signed during a totally different era.
55%,,,,"The case cannot be even -- the case is more strong today than it was on September 10th that the ABM is outmoded, outdated, reflects a different time."
55%,,,,And I'm more than -- I am more than anxious to continue making my case to them.

75%,,,,The enemy who appeared on September 11th seeks to evade our strength and constantly searches for our weaknesses.

76%,othering,,,"And when they have it, they use it without mercy."
76%,,,,The great threat to civilization is not that the terrorists will inspire millions.
76%,othering,,,Only the terrorists themselves would want to live in their brutal and joyless world.

77%,elevation,,,We will discover and destroy sleeper cells.
77%,elevation,,,"We will track terrorist movements, trace their communications, disrupt their funding, and take their network apart, piece by piece."

77%,,,,Rogue states are clearly the most likely sources of chemical and biological and nuclear weapons for terrorists.
77%,,,,"Every nation now knows that we cannot accept -- and we will not accept -- states that harbor, finance, train, or equip the agents of terror."
77%,,hostile,,Those nations that violate this principle will be regarded as hostile regimes.
77%,,,,"They have been warned, they are being watched, and they will be held to account."
77%,,,,Preventing mass terror will be the responsibilities of Presidents far into the future.
77%,,,,And this obligation sets three urgent and enduring priorities for America.
77%,,,,The first priority is to speed the transformation of our military.
77%,,,,"When the Cold War ended, some predicted that the era of direct threats to our nation was over."
77%,,,,"Some thought our military would be used overseas -- not to win wars, but mainly to police and pacify, to control crowds and contain ethnic conflict."
77%,,,,They were wrong.
77%,,,,"While the threats to America have changed, the need for victory has not."
77%,othering,,,"We are fighting shadowy, entrenched enemies -- enemies using the tools of terror and guerrilla war -- yet we are finding new tactics and new weapons to attack and defeat them."
77%,,,,"This revolution in our military is only beginning, and it promises to change the face of battle."
78%,,,,Afghanistan has been a proving ground for this new approach.
78%,,,,These past two months have shown that an innovative doctrine and high-tech weaponry can shape and then dominate an unconventional conflict.
78%,elevation,,,The brave men and women of our military are rewriting the rules of war with new technologies and old values like courage and honor.

78%,,,,"Our commanders are gaining a real-time picture of the entire battlefield, and are able to get targeting information from sensor to shooter almost instantly."
78%,,,,"Our intelligence professionals and special forces have cooperated in battle-friendly -- with battle-friendly Afghan forces -- fighters who know the terrain, who know the Taliban, and who understand the local culture."
78%,,,,"And our special forces have the technology to call in precision air strikes -- along with the flexibility to direct those strikes from horseback, in the first cavalry charge of the 21st century."
78%,,,,"This combination -- real-time intelligence, local allied forces, special forces, and precision air power -- has really never been used before."
78%,,,,The conflict in Afghanistan has taught us more about the future of our military than a decade of blue ribbon panels and think-tank symposiums.
78%,,,,The Predator is a good example.
78%,,,,"This unmanned aerial vehicle is able to circle over enemy forces, gather intelligence, transmit information instantly back to commanders, then fire on targets with extreme accuracy."
78%,,,,"Before the war, the Predator had skeptics, because it did not fit the old ways."
78%,,,,Now it is clear the military does not have enough unmanned vehicles.
78%,,,,"We're entering an era in which unmanned vehicles of all kinds will take on greater importance -- in space, on land, in the air, and at sea."
78%,,,,Precision-guided munitions also offer great promise.
78%,,,,"In the Gulf War, these weapons were the exception --"
79%,,,,"while in Afghanistan, they have been the majority of the munitions we have used."
79%,,,,"We're striking with greater effectiveness, at greater range, with fewer civilian casualties."
79%,,,,"More and more, our weapons can hit moving targets."
79%,,,,When all of our military can continuously locate and track moving targets -- with surveillance from air and space -- warfare will be truly revolutionized.
79%,,,,"The need for military transformation was clear before the conflict in Afghanistan, and before September the 11th."
79%,,,,"Here at the Citadel in 1999, I spoke of keeping the peace by redefining war on our terms."
