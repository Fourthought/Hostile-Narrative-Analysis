,,"Thank you very kindly, my friends."
,,"As I listened to Ralph Abernathy and his eloquent and generous introduction and then thought about myself, I wondered who he was talking about."
,,It's always good to have your closest friend and associate to say something good about you.
,,And Ralph Abernathy is the best friend that I have in the world.
,,I'm delighted to see each of you here tonight in spite of a storm warning.
,,You reveal that you are determined to go on anyhow.
,,Something is happening in Memphis; something is happening in our world.
,,"And you know, if I were standing at the beginning of time, with the possibility of taking a kind of general and panoramic view of the whole of human history up to now, and the Almighty said to me, ""Martin Luther King, which age would you like to live in?"
,,""" I would take my mental flight by Egypt and I would watch God's children in their magnificent trek from the dark dungeons of Egypt through, or rather across the Red Sea, through the wilderness on toward the promised land."
,,"And in spite of its magnificence, I wouldn't stop there."
,,I would move on by Greece and take my mind to Mount Olympus.
,,"And I would see Plato, Aristotle, Socrates, Euripides and Aristophanes assembled around the Parthenon."
,,And I would watch them around the Parthenon as they discussed the great and eternal issues of reality.
,,But I wouldn't stop there.
,,"I would go on, even to the great heyday of the Roman Empire."
,,"And I would see developments around there, through various emperors and leaders."
,,But I wouldn't stop there.
,,"I would even come up to the day of the Renaissance, and get a quick picture of all that the Renaissance did for the cultural and aesthetic life of man."
,,But I wouldn't stop there.
,,I would even go by the way that the man for whom I am named had his habitat.
,,And I would watch Martin Luther as he tacked his ninety-five theses on the door at the church of Wittenberg.
,,But I wouldn't stop there.
,,"I would come on up even to 1863, and watch a vacillating President by the name of Abraham Lincoln finally come to the conclusion that he had to sign the Emancipation Proclamation."
,,But I wouldn't stop there.
,,"I would even come up to the early thirties, and see a man grappling with the problems of the bankruptcy of his nation."
,,"And come with an eloquent cry that we have nothing to fear but ""fear itself."""
,,But I wouldn't stop there.
,,"Strangely enough, I would turn to the Almighty, and say, ""If you allow me to live just a few years in the second half of the 20th century, I will be happy."""
,,"Now that's a strange statement to make, because the world is all messed up."
,,The nation is sick.
,,Trouble is in the land; confusion all around.
,,That's a strange statement.
,,"But I know, somehow, that only when it is dark enough can you see the stars."
,,"And I see God working in this period of the twentieth century in a way that men, in some strange way, are responding."
,,Something is happening in our world.
,,The masses of people are rising up.
,,"And wherever they are assembled today, whether they are in Johannesburg, South Africa; Nairobi, Kenya; Accra, Ghana; New York City; Atlanta, Georgia; Jackson, Mississippi; or Memphis, Tennessee -- the cry is always the same: ""We want to be free."""
,,"And another reason that I'm happy to live in this period is that we have been forced to a point where we are going to have to grapple with the problems that men have been trying to grapple with through history, but the demands didn't force them to do it."
,,Survival demands that we grapple with them.
,,"Men, for years now, have been talking about war and peace."
,,"But now, no longer can they just talk about it."
,,It is no longer a choice between violence and nonviolence in this world; it's nonviolence or nonexistence.
,,That is where we are today.
,,"And also in the human rights revolution, if something isn't done, and done in a hurry, to bring the colored peoples of the world out of their long years of poverty, their long years of hurt and neglect, the whole world is doomed."
,,"Now, I'm just happy that God has allowed me to live in this period to see what is unfolding."
,,And I'm happy that He's allowed me to be in Memphis.
,,"I can remember -- I can remember when Negroes were just going around as Ralph has said, so often, scratching where they didn't itch, and laughing when they were not tickled."
,,But that day is all over.
,,"We mean business now, and we are determined to gain our rightful place in God's world."
,,And that's all this whole thing is about.
,,We aren't engaged in any negative protest and in any negative arguments with anybody.
,,We are saying that we are determined to be men.
,,We are determined to be people.
,,We are saying -- We are saying that we are God's children.
,,"And that we are God's children, we don't have to live like we are forced to live."
,,"Now, what does all of this mean in this great period of history?"
,,It means that we've got to stay together.
,,We've got to stay together and maintain unity.
,,"You know, whenever Pharaoh wanted to prolong the period of slavery in Egypt, he had a favorite, favorite formula for doing it."
,,What was that?
,,He kept the slaves fighting among themselves.
,,"But whenever the slaves get together, something happens in Pharaoh's court, and he cannot hold the slaves in slavery."
,,"When the slaves get together, that's the beginning of getting out of slavery."
,,Now let us maintain unity.
,,"Secondly, let us keep the issues where they are."
,,The issue is injustice.
,,"The issue is the refusal of Memphis to be fair and honest in its dealings with its public servants, who happen to be sanitation workers."
,,"Now, we've got to keep attention on that."
,,That's always the problem with a little violence.
,,"You know what happened the other day, and the press dealt only with the window-breaking."
,,I read the articles.
,,"They very seldom got around to mentioning the fact that one thousand, three hundred sanitation workers are on strike, and that Memphis is not being fair to them, and that Mayor Loeb is in dire need of a doctor."
,,They didn't get around to that.
,,"Now we're going to march again, and we've got to march again, in order to put the issue where it is supposed to be -- and force everybody to see that there are thirteen hundred of God's children here suffering, sometimes going hungry, going through dark and dreary nights wondering how this thing is going to come out."
,,That's the issue.
,,And we've got to say to the nation
,,: We know how it's coming out.
,,"For when people get caught up with that which is right and they are willing to sacrifice for it, there is no stopping point short of victory."
,,We aren't going to let any mace stop us.
,,We are masters in our nonviolent movement in disarming police forces; they don't know what to do.
,,I've seen them so often.
,,"I remember in Birmingham, Alabama, when we were in that majestic struggle there, we would move out of the 16th Street Baptist Church day after day; by the hundreds we would move out."
,,"And Bull Connor would tell them to send the dogs forth, and they did come; but we just went before the dogs singing,"
,,"""Ain't gonna let nobody turn me around."""
,,"Bull Connor next would say, ""Turn the fire hoses on."""
,,"And as I said to you the other night, Bull Connor didn't know history."
,,He knew a kind of physics that somehow didn't relate to the transphysics that we knew about.
,,And that was the fact that there was a certain kind of fire that no water could put out.
,,And we went before the fire hoses; we had known water.
,,"If we were Baptist or some other denominations, we had been immersed."
,,"If we were Methodist, and some others, we had been sprinkled, but we knew water."
,,That couldn't stop us.
,,"And we just went on before the dogs and we would look at them; and we'd go on before the water hoses and we would look at it, and we'd just go on singing ""Over my head"
,,I see freedom in the air.
,,""""
,,"And then we would be thrown in the paddy wagons, and sometimes we were stacked in there like sardines in a can."
,,"And they would throw us in, and old Bull would say, ""Take 'em off,"" and they did; and we would just go in the paddy wagon singing, ""We Shall Overcome."""
,,"And every now and then we'd get in jail, and we'd see the jailers looking through the windows being moved by our prayers, and being moved by our words and our songs."
,,"And there was a power there which Bull Connor couldn't adjust to; and so we ended up transforming Bull into a steer, and we won our struggle in Birmingham."
,,Now we've got to go on in Memphis just like that.
,,I call upon you to be with us when we go out Monday.
,,"Now about injunctions: We have an injunction and we're going into court tomorrow morning to fight this illegal, unconstitutional injunction."
,,"All we say to America is, ""Be true to what you said on paper."
,,""" If I lived in China or even Russia, or any totalitarian country, maybe I could understand some of these illegal injunctions."
,,"Maybe I could understand the denial of certain basic First Amendment privileges, because they hadn't committed themselves to that over there."
,,But somewhere I read of the freedom of assembly.
,,Somewhere I read of the freedom of speech.
,,Somewhere I read of the freedom of press.
,,Somewhere I read that the greatness of America is the right to protest for right.
,,"And so just as I say, we aren't going to let dogs or water hoses turn us around"
,,", we aren't going to let any injunction turn us around."
,,We are going on.
,,We need all of you.
,,And you know what's beautiful to me is to see all of these ministers of the Gospel.
,,It's a marvelous picture.
,,Who is it that is supposed to articulate the longings and aspirations of the people more than the preacher?
,,Somehow the preacher must have a kind of fire shut up in his bones.
,,And whenever injustice is around he tell it.
,,"Somehow the preacher must be an Amos, and saith, ""When God speaks who can but prophesy?"""
,,"Again with Amos, ""Let justice roll down like waters and righteousness like a mighty stream."""
,,"Somehow the preacher must say with Jesus, ""The Spirit of the Lord is upon me, because he hath anointed me,"" and he's anointed me to deal with the problems of the poor."""
,,"And I want to commend the preachers, under the leadership of these noble men:"
,,"James Lawson, one who has been in this struggle for many years; he's been to jail for struggling; he's been kicked out of Vanderbilt University for this struggle, but he's still going on, fighting for the rights of his people."
,,"Reverend Ralph Jackson, Billy Kiles"
,,"; I could just go right on down the list, but time will not permit."
,,But I want to thank all of them.
,,"And I want you to thank them, because so often, preachers aren't concerned about anything but themselves."
,,And I'm always happy to see a relevant ministry.
,,"It's all right to talk about ""long white robes over yonder,"" in all of its symbolism."
,,But ultimately people want some suits and dresses and shoes to wear down here!
,,"It's all right to talk about ""streets flowing with milk and honey,"" but God has commanded us to be concerned about the slums down here, and his children who can't eat three square meals a day."
,,"It's all right to talk about the new Jerusalem, but one day, God's preacher must talk about the new New York, the new Atlanta, the new Philadelphia, the new Los Angeles, the new Memphis, Tennessee."
,,This is what we have to do.
,,Now the other thing we'll have to do is this: Always anchor our external direct action with the power of economic withdrawal.
,,"Now, we are poor people."
,,"Individually, we are poor when you compare us with white society in America."
,,We are poor.
,,"Never stop and forget that collectively -- that means all of us together -- collectively we are richer than all the nations in the world, with the exception of nine."
,,Did you ever think about that?
,,"After you leave the United States, Soviet Russia, Great Britain, West Germany, France, and I could name the others, the American Negro collectively is richer than most nations of the world."
,,"We have an annual income of more than thirty billion dollars a year, which is more than all of the exports of the United States, and more than the national budget of Canada."
,,Did you know that?
,,That's power
,,"right there, if we know how to pool it."
,,We don't have to argue with anybody.
,,We don't have to curse and go around acting bad with our words.
,,We don't need any bricks and bottles.
,,We don't need any Molotov cocktails.
,,"We just need to go around to these stores, and to these massive industries in our country, and say,  ""God sent us by here, to say to you that you're not treating  his children right."
,,"And we've come by here to ask you to make  the first item on your agenda fair treatment, where God's  children are concerned."
,,"Now, if you are not prepared to do  that, we do have an agenda that we must follow."
,,"And our  agenda calls for withdrawing economic support from you."""
,,"And so, as a result of this, we are asking you tonight, to go out and tell your neighbors not to buy Coca-Cola in Memphis."
,,Go by and tell them not to buy Sealtest milk.
,,Tell them not to buy -- what is the other bread?
,,-­Wonder
,,Bread.
,,"And what is the other bread company, Jesse?"
,,Tell them not to buy Hart's bread.
,,"As Jesse Jackson has said, up to now, only the garbage men have been feeling pain; now we must kind of redistribute the pain."
,,We are choosing these companies because they haven't been fair in their hiring policies; and we are choosing them because they can begin the process of saying they are going to support the needs and the rights of these men who are on strike.
,,And then they can move on town -­downtown and tell Mayor Loeb to do what is right.
,,"But not only that, we've got to strengthen black institutions."
,,I call upon you to take your money out of the banks downtown and deposit your money in Tri-State Bank.
,,"We want a ""bank-in"" movement in Memphis."
,,Go by the savings and loan association.
,,I'm not asking you something that we don't do ourselves at SCLC.
,,Judge Hooks and others will tell you that we have an account here in the savings and loan association from the Southern Christian Leadership Conference.
,,We are telling you to follow what we are doing.
,,Put your money there.
,,You have six or seven black insurance companies here in the city of Memphis.
,,Take out your insurance there.
,,"We want to have an ""insurance-in."
,,""""
,,Now these are some practical things that we can do.
,,We begin the process of building a greater economic base.
,,"And at the same time, we are putting pressure where it really hurts."
,,I ask you to follow through here.
,,"Now, let me say as I move to my conclusion that we've got to give ourselves to this struggle until the end."
,,Nothing would be more tragic than to stop at this point in Memphis.
,,We've got to see it through.
,,"And when we have our march, you need to be there."
,,"If it means leaving work, if it means leaving school -- be there."
,,Be concerned about your brother.
,,You may not be on strike.
,,"But either we go up together, or we go down together."
,,Let us develop a kind of dangerous unselfishness.
,,"One day a man came to Jesus, and he wanted to raise some questions about some vital matters of life."
,,"At points he wanted to trick Jesus, and show him that he knew a little more than Jesus knew and throw him off base...."
,,Now that question could have easily ended up in a philosophical and theological debate.
,,"But Jesus immediately pulled that question from mid­air, and placed it on a dangerous curve between Jerusalem and Jericho."
,,"And he talked about a certain man, who fell among thieves."
,,You remember that a Levite and a priest passed by on the other side.
,,They didn't stop to help him.
,,And finally a man of another race came by.
,,"He got down from his beast, decided not to be compassionate by proxy."
,,"But he got down with him, administered first aid, and helped the man in need."
,,"Jesus ended up saying, this was the good man, this was the great man, because he had the capacity to project the ""I"" into the ""thou,"" and to be concerned about his brother."
,,"Now you know, we use our imagination a great deal to try to determine why the priest and the Levite didn't stop."
,,"At times we say they were busy going to a church meeting, an ecclesiastical gathering, and they had to get on down to Jerusalem so they wouldn't be late for their meeting."
,,"At other times we would speculate that there was a religious law that ""One who was engaged in religious ceremonials was not to touch a human body twenty-four hours before the ceremony."""
,,And every now and then we begin to wonder whether maybe they were not going down to Jerusalem
,,"-­or down to Jericho, rather to organize a ""Jericho Road Improvement Association."
,,""" That's a possibility."
,,"Maybe they felt that it was better to deal with the problem from the causal root, rather than to get bogged down with an individual effect."
,,But I'm going to tell you what my imagination tells me.
,,It's possible that those men were afraid.
,,"You see, the Jericho road is a dangerous road."
,,I remember when Mrs. King and I were first in Jerusalem.
,,We rented a car and drove from Jerusalem down to Jericho.
,,"And as soon as we got on that road, I said to my wife, ""I can see why Jesus used this as the setting for his parable."
,,""" It's a winding, meandering road."
,,It's really conducive for ambushing.
,,"You start out in Jerusalem, which is about 1200 miles -- or rather 1200 feet above sea level."
,,"And by the time you get down to Jericho, fifteen or twenty minutes later, you're about 2200 feet below sea level."
,,That's a dangerous road.
,,"In the days of Jesus it came to be known as the ""Bloody Pass."
,,""""
,,"And you know, it's possible that the priest and the Levite looked over that man on the ground and wondered if the robbers were still around."
,,Or it's possible that they felt that the man on the ground was merely faking.
,,"And he was acting like he had been robbed and hurt, in order to seize them over there, lure them there for quick and easy seizure."
,,"And so the first question that the priest asked -- the first question that the Levite asked was, ""If I stop to help this man, what will happen to me?"""
,,But then the Good Samaritan came by.
,,"And he reversed the question: ""If I do not stop to help this man, what will happen to him?"
,,""""
,,That's the question before you tonight.
,,"Not, ""If I stop to help the sanitation workers, what will happen to my job."
,,"Not, ""If I stop to help the sanitation workers what will happen to all of the hours that I usually spend in my office every day and every week as a pastor?"
,,""" The question is not, ""If I stop to help this man in need, what will happen to me?"
,,""" The question is, ""If I do not stop to help the sanitation workers, what will happen to them?"""
,,That's the question.
,,Let us rise up tonight with a greater readiness.
,,Let us stand with a greater determination.
,,"And let us move on in these powerful days, these days of challenge to make America what it ought to be."
,,We have an opportunity to make America a better nation.
,,"And I want to thank God, once more, for allowing me to be here with you."
,,"You know, several years ago, I was in New York City autographing the first book that I had written."
,,"And while sitting there autographing books, a demented black woman came up."
,,"The only question I heard from her was, ""Are you Martin Luther King?"""
,,"And I was looking down writing, and I said, ""Yes."""
,,And the next minute I felt something beating on my chest.
,,Before I knew it I had been stabbed by this demented woman.
,,I was rushed to Harlem Hospital.
,,It was a dark Saturday afternoon.
,,"And that blade had gone through, and the X-rays revealed that the tip of the blade was on the edge of my aorta, the main artery."
,,"And once that's punctured, your drowned in your own blood -- that's the end of you."
,,"It came out in the New York Times the next morning, that if I had merely sneezed, I would have died."
,,"Well, about four days later, they allowed me, after the operation, after my chest had been opened, and the blade had been taken out, to move around in the wheel chair in the hospital."
,,"They allowed me to read some of the mail that came in, and from all over the states and the world, kind letters came in."
,,"I read a few, but one of them I will never forget."
,,I had received one from the President and the Vice-President.
,,I've forgotten what those telegrams said.
,,"I'd received a visit and a letter from the Governor of New York, but I've forgotten what that letter said."
,,"But there was another letter that came from a little girl, a young girl who was a student at the White Plains High School."
,,"And I looked at that letter, and I'll never forget it."
,,"It said simply,  """
,,"Dear Dr. King,  I am a ninth-grade student at the White Plains High School."
,,""""
,,"And she said,"
,,"""While it should not matter, I would like to mention that I'm a white girl."
,,"I read in the paper of your misfortune, and of your suffering."
,,"And I read that if you had sneezed, you would have died."
,,And I'm simply writing you to say that I'm so happy that you didn't sneeze.
,,""""
,,And I want to say tonight
,,-- I want to say tonight that I too am happy that I didn't sneeze.
,,"Because if I had sneezed, I wouldn't have been around here in 1960, when students all over the South started sitting-in at lunch counters."
,,"And I knew that as they were sitting in, they were really standing up for the best in the American dream, and taking the whole nation back to those great wells of democracy which were dug deep by the Founding Fathers in the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution."
,,"If I had sneezed, I wouldn't have been around here in 1961, when we decided to take a ride for freedom and ended segregation in inter-state travel."
,,"If I had sneezed, I wouldn't have been around here in 1962, when Negroes in Albany, Georgia, decided to straighten their backs up."
,,"And whenever men and women straighten their backs up, they are going somewhere, because a man can't ride your back unless it is bent."
,,"If I had sneezed -- If I had sneezed I wouldn't have been here in 1963, when the black people of Birmingham, Alabama, aroused the conscience of this nation, and brought into being the Civil Rights Bill."
,,"If I had sneezed, I wouldn't have had a chance later that year, in August, to try to tell America about a dream that I had had."
,,"If I had sneezed, I wouldn't have been down in Selma, Alabama, to see the great Movement there."
,,"If I had sneezed, I wouldn't have been in Memphis to see a community rally around those brothers and sisters who are suffering."
,,I'm so happy that I didn't sneeze.
,,And they were telling me --.
,,"Now, it doesn't matter, now."
,,It really doesn't matter what happens now.
,,"I left Atlanta this morning, and as we got started on the plane, there were six of us."
,,"The pilot said over the public address system, ""We are sorry for the delay, but we have Dr. Martin Luther King on the plane."
,,"And to be sure that all of the bags were checked, and to be sure that nothing would be wrong with on the plane, we had to check out everything carefully."
,,And we've had the plane protected and guarded all night.
,,""""
,,And then I got into Memphis.
,,"And some began to say the threats, or talk about the threats that were out."
,,What would happen to me from some of our sick white brothers?
,,"Well, I don't know what will happen now."
,,We've got some difficult days ahead.
,,"But it really doesn't matter with me now, because I've been to the mountaintop."
,,And I don't mind.
,,"Like anybody, I would like to live a long life."
,,Longevity has its place.
,,But I'm not concerned about that now.
,,I just want to do God's will.
,,And He's allowed me to go up to the mountain.
,,And I've looked over.
,,And I've seen the Promised Land.
,,I may not get there with you.
,,"But I want you to know tonight, that we, as a people, will get to the promised land!"
,,"And so I'm happy, tonight."
,,I'm not worried about anything.
,,I'm not fearing any man!
,,Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord!!
,,I am happy to join with you today in what will go down in history as the greatest demonstration for freedom in the history of our nation.
,,"Five score years ago, a great American, in whose symbolic shadow we  stand today, signed the Emancipation Proclamation."
,,This momentous decree came as a great beacon light of hope to millions of Negro slaves who had been seared in the flames of withering injustice.
,,It came as a joyous daybreak to end the long night of their captivity.
,,"But one hundred years later, the Negro still is not free."
,,"One hundred years later, the life of the Negro is still sadly crippled by the manacles of segregation and the chains of discrimination."
,,"One hundred years later, the Negro lives on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity."
,,"One hundred years later, the Negro is still languished in the corners of American society and finds himself an exile in his own land."
,,And so we've come here today to dramatize a shameful condition.
,,In a sense we've come to our nation's capital to cash a check.
,,"When the architects of our republic wrote the magnificent words of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence, they were signing a promissory note to which every American was to fall heir."
,,"This note was a promise that all men, yes, black men as well as white men, would be guaranteed the ""unalienable Rights"" of ""Life, Liberty and the pursuit of Happiness."
,,""" It is obvious today that America has defaulted on this promissory note, insofar as her citizens of color are concerned."
,,"Instead of honoring this sacred obligation, America has given the Negro people a bad check, a check which has come back marked ""insufficient funds."
,,""""
,,But we refuse to believe that the bank of justice is bankrupt.
,,We refuse to believe that there are insufficient funds in the great vaults of opportunity of this nation.
,,"And so, we've come to cash this check, a check that will give us upon demand the riches of freedom and the security of justice."
,,We have also come to this hallowed spot to remind America of the fierce urgency of Now.
,,This is no time to engage in the luxury of cooling off or to take the tranquilizing drug of gradualism.
,,Now is the time to make real the promises of democracy.
,,Now is the time to rise from the dark and desolate valley of segregation to the sunlit path of racial justice.
,,Now is the time to lift our nation from the quicksands of racial injustice to the solid rock of brotherhood.
,,Now is the time to make justice a reality for all of God's children.
,,It would be fatal for the nation to overlook the urgency of the moment.
,,This sweltering summer of the Negro's legitimate discontent will not pass until there is an invigorating autumn of freedom and equality.
,,"Nineteen sixty-three is not an end, but a beginning."
,,And those who hope that the Negro needed to blow off steam and will now be content will have a rude awakening if the nation returns to business as usual.
,,And there will be neither rest nor tranquility in America until the Negro is granted his citizenship rights.
,,The whirlwinds of revolt will continue to shake the foundations of our nation until the bright day of justice emerges.
,,"But there is something that I must say to my people, who stand on the warm threshold which leads into the palace of justice: In the process of gaining our rightful place, we must not be guilty of wrongful deeds."
,,Let us not seek to satisfy our thirst for freedom by drinking from the cup of bitterness and hatred.
,,We must forever conduct our struggle on the high plane of dignity and discipline.
,,We must not allow our creative protest to degenerate into physical violence.
,,"Again and again, we must rise to the majestic heights of meeting physical force with soul force."
,,"The marvelous new militancy which has engulfed the Negro community must not lead us to a distrust of all white people, for many of our white brothers, as evidenced by their presence here today, have come to realize that their destiny is tied up with our destiny."
,,And they have come to realize that their freedom is inextricably bound to our freedom.
,,We cannot walk alone.
,,"And as we walk, we must make the pledge that we shall always march ahead."
,,We cannot turn back.
,,"There are those who are asking the devotees of civil rights, ""When will you be satisfied?"
,,""" We can never be satisfied as long as the Negro is the victim of the unspeakable horrors of police brutality."
,,"We can never be satisfied as long as our bodies, heavy with the fatigue of travel, cannot gain lodging in the motels of the highways and the hotels of the cities."
,,*
,,*We cannot be satisfied as long as the negro's basic mobility is from a smaller ghetto to a larger one.
,,"We can never be satisfied as long as our children are stripped of their self-hood and robbed of their dignity by signs stating: ""For Whites Only."""
,,** We cannot be satisfied as long as a Negro in Mississippi cannot vote and a Negro in New York believes he has nothing for which to vote.
,,"No, no, we are not satisfied, and we will not be satisfied until ""justice rolls down  like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream."
,,""""
,,I am not unmindful that some of you have come here out of great trials and tribulations.
,,Some of you have come fresh from narrow jail cells.
,,And some of you have come from areas where your quest -- quest for freedom left you battered by the storms of persecution and staggered by the winds of police brutality.
,,You have been the veterans of creative suffering.
,,Continue to work with the faith that unearned suffering is redemptive.
,,"Go back to Mississippi, go back to Alabama, go back to South Carolina, go back to Georgia, go back to Louisiana, go back to the slums and ghettos of our northern cities, knowing that somehow this situation can and will be changed."
,,"Let us not wallow in the valley of despair, I say to you today, my friends."
,,"And so even though we face the difficulties of today and tomorrow, I still have a dream."
,,It is a dream deeply rooted in the American dream.
,,"I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and live out the true meaning of its creed: ""We hold these truths to be self-evident, that all men are created equal."
,,""""
,,"I have a dream that one day on the red hills of Georgia, the sons of former slaves and the sons of former slave owners will be able to sit down together at the table of brotherhood."
,,"I have a dream that one day even the state of Mississippi, a state sweltering with the heat of injustice, sweltering with the heat of oppression, will be transformed into an oasis of freedom and justice."
,,I have a dream that my four little children will one day live in a nation where they will not be judged by the color of their skin but by the content of their character.
,,I have a dream today!
,,"I have a dream that one day, down in Alabama, with its vicious racists, with its governor having his lips dripping with the words of ""interposition"" and ""nullification"" -- one day right there in Alabama little black boys and black girls will be able to join hands with little white boys and white girls as sisters and brothers."
,,I have a dream today!
,,"I have a dream that one day every valley shall be exalted, and every hill and mountain shall be made low, the rough places will be made plain, and the crooked places will be made straight; ""and the glory of the Lord shall be  revealed and all flesh shall see it together."""
,,"This is our hope, and this is the faith that I go back to the South with."
,,"With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope."
,,"With this faith, we will be able to transform the jangling discords of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood."
,,"With this faith, we will be able to work together, to pray together, to struggle together, to go to jail together, to stand up for freedom together, knowing that we will be free one day."
,,And this will be the day -- this will be the day when all of God's children will be able to sing with new meaning:
,,"My country 'tis of thee, sweet land of liberty, of thee"
,,I sing.
,,"Land where my fathers died, land of the Pilgrim's pride,  From every mountainside, let freedom ring!"
,,"And if America is to be a great nation, this must become true."
,,And so let freedom ring from the prodigious hilltops of New Hampshire.
,,Let freedom ring from the mighty mountains of New York.
,,Let freedom ring from the heightening Alleghenies of Pennsylvania.
,,Let freedom ring from the snow-capped Rockies of Colorado.
,,Let freedom ring from the curvaceous slopes of California.
,,But not only that: Let freedom ring from Stone Mountain of Georgia.
,,Let freedom ring from Lookout Mountain of Tennessee.
,,Let freedom ring from every hill and molehill of Mississippi.
,,"From every mountainside, let freedom ring."
,,"And when this happens, and when we allow freedom ring, when we let it ring from every village and every hamlet, from every state and every city, we will be able to speed up that day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and sing in the words of the old Negro spiritual:"
,,Free at last!
,,Free at last!
,,"Thank God Almighty, we are free at last!"
,,"My dear and abiding friends, Ralph Abernathy, and to all of the distinguished Americans seated here on the rostrum, my friends and co-workers of the state of Alabama, and to all of the freedom-loving people who have assembled here this afternoon from all over our nation and from all over the world: Last Sunday, more than eight thousand of us started on a mighty walk from Selma, Alabama."
,,We have walked through desolate valleys and across the trying hills.
,,We have walked on meandering highways and rested our bodies on rocky byways.
,,Some of our faces are burned from the outpourings of the sweltering sun.
,,Some have literally slept in the mud.
,,We have been drenched by the rains.
,,[Audience:]
,,(Speak)
,,Our bodies are tired and our feet are somewhat sore.
,,"But today as I stand before you and think back over that great march, I can say, as Sister Pollard said—a seventy-year-old Negro woman who lived in this community during the bus"
,,boycott—and
,,"one day, she was asked while walking if she didn’t want to ride."
,,"And when she answered, ""No,"" the person said, ""Well, aren’t you tired?"""
,,"And with her ungrammatical profundity, she said, ""My feets is tired, but my soul is rested."""
,,"(Yes, sir."
,,All right)
,,"And in a real sense this afternoon, we can say that our feet are tired, (Yes, sir)"
,,but our souls are rested.
,,They told us we wouldn’t get here.
,,"And there were those who said that we would get here only over their dead bodies, (Well."
,,"Yes, sir."
,,Talk)
,,"but all the world today knows that we are here and we are standing before the forces of power in the state of Alabama saying, ""We ain’t"
,,"goin’ let nobody turn us around."""
,,"(Yes, sir."
,,Speak)
,,[Applause]
,,"Now it is not an accident that one of the great marches of American history should terminate in Montgomery, Alabama."
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,"Just ten years ago, in this very city, a new philosophy was born of the Negro struggle."
,,Montgomery was the first city in the South in which the entire Negro community united and squarely faced its age-old oppressors.
,,"(Yes, sir."
,,Well)
,,"Out of this struggle, more than bus [de]segregation was won; a new idea, more powerful than guns or clubs was born."
,,Negroes took it and carried it across the South in epic battles
,,"(Yes, sir."
,,Speak) that electrified the nation (Well) and the world.
,,"Yet, strangely, the climactic conflicts always were fought and won on Alabama soil."
,,"After Montgomery’s, heroic confrontations loomed up in Mississippi, Arkansas, Georgia, and elsewhere."
,,But not until the colossus of segregation was challenged in Birmingham did the conscience of America begin to bleed.
,,White America was profoundly aroused by Birmingham because it witnessed the whole community of Negroes facing terror and brutality with majestic scorn and heroic courage.
,,"And from the wells of this democratic spirit, the nation finally forced Congress (Well) to write legislation (Yes, sir) in the hope that it would eradicate the stain of Birmingham."
,,"The Civil Rights Act of 1964 gave Negroes some part of their rightful dignity, (Speak, sir)"
,,but without the vote it was dignity without strength.
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,"Once more the method of nonviolent resistance (Yes) was unsheathed from its scabbard, and once again an entire community was mobilized to confront the adversary."
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,And again the brutality of a dying order shrieks across the land.
,,"Yet, Selma, Alabama, became a shining moment in the conscience of man."
,,"If the worst in American life lurked in its dark streets, the best of American instincts arose passionately from across the nation to overcome it."
,,"(Yes, sir."
,,Speak)
,,"There never was a moment in American history (Yes, sir) more honorable and more inspiring than the pilgrimage of clergymen and laymen of every race and faith pouring into Selma to face danger"
,,(Yes) at the side of its embattled Negroes.
,,"The confrontation of good and evil compressed in the tiny community of Selma (Speak, speak) generated the massive power (Yes, sir."
,,"Yes, sir) to turn the whole nation to a new course."
,,"A president born in the South (Well) had the sensitivity to feel the will of the country, (Speak, sir) and in an address that will live in history as one of the most passionate pleas for human rights ever made by a president of our nation, he pledged the might of the federal government to cast off the centuries-old blight."
,,President Johnson rightly praised the courage of the Negro for awakening the conscience of the nation.
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,On our part we must pay our profound respects to the white Americans who cherish their democratic traditions over the ugly customs and privileges of generations and come forth boldly to join hands with us.
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,"From Montgomery to Birmingham, (Yes, sir) from Birmingham to Selma, (Yes, sir) from Selma back to Montgomery, (Yes) a trail wound in a circle long and often bloody, yet it has become a highway up from darkness."
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,"Alabama has tried to nurture and defend evil, but evil is choking to death in the dusty roads and streets of this state."
,,"(Yes, sir."
,,"Speak, sir)"
,,So I stand before you this afternoon
,,"(Speak, sir."
,,"Well) with the conviction that segregation is on its deathbed in Alabama, and the only thing uncertain about it is how costly the segregationists and Wallace will make the funeral."
,,(Go ahead.
,,"Yes, sir)"
,,[Applause]
,,Our whole campaign in Alabama has been centered around the right to vote.
,,"In focusing the attention of the nation and the world today on the flagrant denial of the right to vote, we are exposing the very origin, the root cause, of racial segregation in the Southland."
,,Racial segregation as a way of life did not come about as a natural result of hatred between the races immediately after the Civil War.
,,There were no laws segregating the races then.
,,"And as the noted historian, C. Vann Woodward, in his book, The Strange Career of Jim Crow, clearly points out, the segregation of the races was really a political stratagem employed by the emerging Bourbon interests in the South to keep the southern masses divided and southern labor the cheapest in the land."
,,"You see, it was a simple thing to keep the poor white masses working for near-starvation wages in the years that followed the Civil War."
,,"Why, if the poor white plantation or mill worker became dissatisfied with his low wages, the plantation or mill owner would merely threaten to fire him and hire former Negro slaves and pay him even less."
,,"Thus, the southern wage level was kept almost unbearably low."
,,"Toward the end of the Reconstruction era, something very significant happened."
,,(Listen to him)
,,That is what was known as the Populist Movement.
,,"(Speak, sir)"
,,The leaders of this movement began awakening the poor white masses
,,"(Yes, sir) and the former Negro slaves to the fact that they were being fleeced by the emerging Bourbon interests."
,,"Not only that, but they began uniting the Negro and white masses"
,,(Yeah) into a voting bloc that threatened to drive the Bourbon interests from the command posts of political power in the South.
,,"To meet this threat, the southern aristocracy began immediately to engineer this development of a segregated society."
,,(Right)
,,I want you to follow me through here because this is very important to see the roots of racism and the denial of the right to vote.
,,"Through their control of mass media, they revised the doctrine of white supremacy."
,,"They saturated the thinking of the poor white masses with it, (Yes) thus clouding their minds to the real issue involved in the Populist Movement."
,,They then directed the placement on the books of the South of laws that made it a crime for Negroes and whites to come together as equals at any level.
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,And that did it.
,,That crippled and eventually destroyed the Populist Movement of the nineteenth century.
,,"If it may be said of the slavery era that the white man took the world and gave the Negro Jesus, then it may be said of the Reconstruction era that the southern aristocracy took the world and gave the poor white man Jim Crow."
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,He gave him Jim Crow.
,,(Uh huh)
,,"And when his wrinkled stomach cried out for the food that his empty pockets could not provide, (Yes, sir)"
,,"he ate Jim Crow, a psychological bird that told him that no matter how bad off he was, at least he was a white man, better than the black man."
,,(Right sir)
,,And he ate Jim Crow.
,,(Uh huh)
,,"And when his undernourished children cried out for the necessities that his low wages could not provide, he showed them the Jim Crow signs on the buses and in the stores, on the streets and in the public buildings."
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,"And his children, too, learned to feed upon Jim Crow, (Speak) their last outpost of psychological oblivion."
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,"Thus, the threat of the free exercise of the ballot by the Negro and the white masses alike (Uh huh) resulted in the establishment of a segregated society."
,,"They segregated southern money from the poor whites; they segregated southern mores from the rich whites; (Yes, sir)"
,,"they segregated southern churches from Christianity (Yes, sir); they segregated southern minds from honest thinking; (Yes, sir) and they segregated the Negro from everything."
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,That’s what happened when the Negro and white masses of the South threatened to unite and build a great society: a society of justice where none would pray upon the weakness of others; a society of plenty where greed and poverty would be done away; a society of brotherhood where every man would respect the dignity and worth of human personality.
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,We’ve come a long way since that travesty of justice was perpetrated upon the American mind.
,,James Weldon Johnson put it eloquently.
,,He said: We have come over a way That with tears hath been watered.
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,We have come treading our paths Through the blood of the slaughtered.
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,"Out of the gloomy past, (Yes, sir)"
,,Till now we stand at last
,,Where the white gleam Of our bright star is cast.
,,"(Speak, sir)"
,,"Today I want to tell the city of Selma, (Tell them, Doctor)"
,,"today I want to say to the state of Alabama, (Yes, sir)"
,,"today I want to say to the people of America and the nations of the world, that we are not about to turn around."
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,We are on the move now.
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,"Yes, we are on the move and no wave of racism can stop us."
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,We are on the move now.
,,The burning of our churches will not deter us.
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,The bombing of our homes will not dissuade us.
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,We are on the move now.
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,The beating and killing of our clergymen and young people will not divert us.
,,We are on the move now.
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,The wanton release of their known murderers would not discourage us.
,,We are on the move now.
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,"Like an idea whose time has come, (Yes, sir) not even the marching of mighty armies can halt us."
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,We are moving to the land of freedom.
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,Let us therefore continue our triumphant march (Uh huh) to the realization of the American dream.
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,Let us march on segregated housing
,,"(Yes, sir) until every ghetto or social and economic depression dissolves, and Negroes and whites live side by side in decent, safe, and sanitary housing."
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,"Let us march on segregated schools (Let us march, Tell it) until every vestige of segregated and inferior education becomes a thing of the past, and Negroes and whites study side-by-side in the socially-healing context of the classroom."
,,Let us march on poverty (Let us march) until no American parent has to skip a meal so that their children may eat.
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,"March on poverty (Let us march) until no starved man walks the streets of our cities and towns (Yes, sir) in search of jobs that do not exist."
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,Let us march on poverty
,,"(Let us march) until wrinkled stomachs in Mississippi are filled, ("
,,"That's right) and the idle industries of Appalachia are realized and revitalized, and broken lives in sweltering ghettos are mended and remolded."
,,"Let us march on ballot boxes, (Let’s march)"
,,march on ballot boxes until race-baiters disappear from the political arena.
,,"Let us march on ballot boxes until the salient misdeeds of bloodthirsty mobs (Yes, sir) will be transformed into the calculated good deeds of orderly citizens."
,,"(Speak, Doctor)"
,,Let us march on ballot boxes (Let us march) until the Wallaces of our nation tremble away in silence.
,,Let us march on ballot boxes (Let us march) until we send to our city councils
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,", state legislatures, (Yes, sir) and the United States Congress, (Yes, sir) men who will not fear to do justly, love mercy, and walk humbly with thy God. Let us march on ballot boxes (Let us march."
,,"March) until brotherhood becomes more than a meaningless word in an opening prayer, but the order of the day on every legislative agenda. Let us march on ballot boxes"
,,(Yes) until all over Alabama God’s children will be able to walk the earth in decency and honor.
,,There is nothing wrong with marching in this sense.
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,The Bible tells us that the mighty men of Joshua merely walked about the walled city of Jericho (Yes) and the barriers to freedom came tumbling down.
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,"I like that old Negro spiritual, (Yes, sir)"
,,"""Joshua Fit the Battle of Jericho."
,,""" In its simple, yet colorful, depiction (Yes, sir) of that great moment in biblical history, it tells us that: Joshua fit the battle of Jericho, (Tell it)"
,,"Joshua fit the battle of Jericho, (Yes, sir)"
,,And the walls come tumbling down.
,,"(Yes, sir."
,,Tell it)
,,"Up to the walls of Jericho they marched, spear in hand."
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,"""Go blow them ramhorns,"" Joshua cried, """
,,"‘Cause the battle am in my hand."""
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,"These words I have given you just as they were given us by the unknown, long-dead, dark-skinned originator."
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,"Some now long-gone black bard bequeathed to posterity these words in ungrammatical form, (Yes, sir) yet with emphatic pertinence for all of us today."
,,(Uh huh) The battle is in our hands.
,,And we can answer with creative nonviolence the call to higher ground to which the new directions of our struggle summons us.
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,The road ahead is not altogether a smooth one.
,,(No) There are no broad highways that lead us easily and inevitably to quick solutions.
,,But we must keep going.
,,"In the glow of the lamplight on my desk a few nights ago, I gazed again upon the wondrous sign of our times, full of hope and promise of the future."
,,(Uh huh)
,,And I smiled to see in the newspaper photographs of many a decade ago
,,", the faces so bright, so solemn, of our valiant heroes, the people of Montgomery."
,,"To this list may be added the names of all those (Yes) who have fought and, yes, died in the nonviolent army of our day: Medgar Evers, (Speak) three civil rights workers in Mississippi last summer, (Uh huh)"
,,"William Moore, as has already been mentioned, (Yes, sir)"
,,"the Reverend James Reeb, (Yes, sir)"
,,"Jimmy Lee Jackson, (Yes, sir) and four little girls in the church of God in Birmingham on Sunday morning."
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,"But in spite of this, we must go on and be sure that they did not die in vain."
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,"The pattern of their feet as they walked through Jim Crow barriers in the great stride toward freedom is the thunder of the marching men of Joshua, (Yes, sir) and the world rocks beneath their tread."
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,"My people, my people, listen."
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,The battle is in our hands.
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,The battle is in our hands in Mississippi and Alabama and all over the United States.
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,"I know there is a cry today in Alabama, (Uh huh) we see it in numerous editorials: ""When will Martin Luther King, SCLC, SNCC, and all of these civil rights agitators and all of the white clergymen and labor leaders and students and others get out of our community and let Alabama return to normalcy?"
,,""""
,,But I have a message that I would like to leave with Alabama this evening.
,,(Tell it)
,,"That is exactly what we don’t want, and we will not allow it to happen, (Yes, sir) for we know that it was normalcy in Marion"
,,"(Yes, sir) that led to the brutal murder of Jimmy Lee Jackson."
,,(Speak)
,,"It was normalcy in Birmingham (Yes) that led to the murder on Sunday morning of four beautiful, unoffending, innocent girls."
,,It was normalcy on Highway 80
,,"(Yes, sir) that led state troopers to use tear gas and horses and billy clubs against unarmed human beings who were simply marching for justice."
,,"(Speak, sir)"
,,"It was normalcy by a cafe in Selma, Alabama, that led to the brutal beating of Reverend James Reeb."
,,"It is normalcy all over our country (Yes, sir) which leaves the Negro perishing on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of vast ocean of material prosperity."
,,It is normalcy all over Alabama
,,(Yeah) that prevents the Negro from becoming a registered voter.
,,(Yes)
,,"No, we will not allow Alabama (Go ahead) to return to normalcy."
,,[Applause]
,,"The only normalcy that we will settle for (Yes, sir) is the normalcy that recognizes the dignity and worth of all of God’s children."
,,"The only normalcy that we will settle for is the normalcy that allows judgment to run down like waters, and righteousness like a mighty stream."
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,"The only normalcy that we will settle for is the normalcy of brotherhood, the normalcy of true peace, the normalcy of justice."
,,"And so as we go away this afternoon, let us go away more than ever before committed to this struggle and committed to nonviolence."
,,I must admit to you that there are still some difficult days ahead.
,,"We are still in for a season of suffering in many of the black belt counties of Alabama, many areas of Mississippi, many areas of Louisiana."
,,"I must admit to you that there are still jail cells waiting for us, and dark and difficult moments."
,,"But if we will go on with the faith that nonviolence and its power can transform dark yesterdays into bright tomorrows, we will be able to change all of these conditions."
,,And so I plead with you this afternoon as we go ahead: remain committed to nonviolence.
,,"Our aim must never be to defeat or humiliate the white man, but to win his friendship and understanding."
,,"We must come to see that the end we seek is a society at peace with itself, a society that can live with its conscience."
,,"And that will be a day not of the white man, not of the black man."
,,That will be the day of man as man.
,,(Yes)
,,"I know you are asking today, ""How long will it take?"""
,,"(Speak, sir)"
,,"Somebody’s asking, ""How long will prejudice blind the visions of men, darken their understanding, and drive bright-eyed wisdom from her sacred throne?"
,,""""
,,"Somebody’s asking, ""When will wounded justice, lying prostrate on the streets of Selma and Birmingham and communities all over the South, be lifted from this dust of shame to reign supreme among the children of men?"
,,""""
,,"Somebody’s asking, ""When will the radiant star of hope be plunged against the nocturnal bosom of this lonely night, (Speak, speak, speak) plucked from weary souls with chains of fear and the manacles of death?"
,,"How long will justice be crucified, (Speak) and truth bear it?"""
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,"I come to say to you this afternoon, however difficult the moment, (Yes, sir) however frustrating the hour, it will not be long, (No sir) because ""truth crushed to earth will rise again."""
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,How long?
,,"Not long, (Yes, sir) because ""no lie can live forever."""
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,How long?
,,"Not long, (All right."
,,"How long) because ""you shall reap what you sow."""
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,How long?
,,(How long?)
,,Not long: (Not long)
,,"Truth forever on the scaffold, (Speak)"
,,"Wrong forever on the throne, (Yes, sir)"
,,"Yet that scaffold sways the future, (Yes, sir)"
,,"And, behind the dim unknown, Standeth God within the shadow, Keeping watch above his own."
,,How long?
,,"Not long, because the arc of the moral universe is long, but it bends toward justice."
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,How long?
,,"Not long, (Not long) because: Mine eyes have seen the glory of the coming of the Lord; (Yes, sir)"
,,He is trampling out the vintage where the grapes of wrath are stored;
,,"(Yes) He has loosed the fateful lightning of his terrible swift sword; (Yes, sir) His truth is marching on."
,,"(Yes, sir)"
,,"He has sounded forth the trumpet that shall never call retreat; (Speak, sir)"
,,He is sifting out the hearts of men before His judgment seat.
,,(That’s right)
,,"O, be swift, my soul, to answer Him!"
,,Be jubilant my feet!
,,Our God is marching on.
,,(Yeah
,,") Glory, hallelujah!"
,,"(Yes, sir) Glory, hallelujah!"
,,(All right)
,,"Glory, hallelujah!"
,,"Glory, hallelujah!"
,,His truth is marching on.
,,[Applause]
,,"Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen:"
,,"I need not pause to say how very delighted I am to be here tonight, and how very delighted I am to see you expressing your concern about the issues that will be discussed tonight by turning out in such large numbers."
,,"I also want to say that I consider it a great honor to share this program with Dr. Bennett, Dr. Commager, and Rabbi Heschel, and some of the distinguished leaders and personalities of our nation."
,,And of course it’s always good to come back to Riverside church.
,,"Over the last eight years, I have had the privilege of preaching here almost every year in that period, and it is always a rich and rewarding experience to come to this great church and this great pulpit."
,,I come to this magnificent house of worship tonight because my conscience leaves me no other choice.
,,I join you in this meeting because I'm in deepest agreement with the aims and work of the organization which has brought us together:
,,Clergy and Laymen Concerned About  Vietnam.
,,"The recent statements of your executive committee are the  sentiments of my own heart, and I found myself in full accord when I read its opening lines: ""A time comes when silence is betrayal."""
,,And that time has come for us in relation to Vietnam.
,,"The truth of these words is beyond doubt, but the mission to which they call us is a most difficult one."
,,"Even when pressed by the demands of inner truth, men do not easily assume the task of opposing their government's policy, especially in time of war."
,,Nor does the human spirit move without great difficulty against all the apathy of conformist thought within one's own bosom and in the surrounding world.
,,"Moreover, when the issues at hand seem as perplexing as they often do in the case of this dreadful conflict, we are always on the verge of being mesmerized by uncertainty; but we must move on."
,,"And some of us who have already begun to break the silence of the night have found that the calling to speak is often a vocation of agony, but we must speak."
,,"We must speak with all the humility that is appropriate to our limited vision, but we must speak."
,,"And we must rejoice as well, for"
,,surely this is the first time in our nation's history that a significant number of its religious leaders have chosen to move beyond the prophesying of smooth patriotism to the high grounds of a firm dissent based upon the mandates of conscience and the reading of history.
,,Perhaps a new spirit is rising among us.
,,"If it is, let us trace its movements and pray that our own inner being may be sensitive to its guidance, for we are deeply in need of a new way beyond the darkness that seems so close around us."
,,"Over the past two years, as I have moved to break the betrayal of my own silences and to speak from the burnings of my own heart, as I have called for radical departures from the destruction of Vietnam, many persons have questioned me about the wisdom of my path."
,,At the heart of their concerns this query has often loomed large and loud:
,,"""Why are you speaking about the war, Dr. King?"""
,,"""Why are you joining the voices of dissent?"""
,,"""Peace and civil rights don't mix,"" they say."
,,"""Aren't you hurting the cause of your people,"" they ask?"
,,"And when I hear them, though I often understand the source of their concern, I am nevertheless greatly saddened, for such questions mean that the inquirers have not really known me, my commitment or my calling."
,,"Indeed, their questions suggest that they do not know the world in which they live."
,,"In the light of such tragic misunderstanding, I deem it of signal importance to try to state clearly, and I trust concisely, why I believe that the path from Dexter Avenue Baptist Church -- the church in Montgomery, Alabama, where I began my pastorate -- leads clearly to this sanctuary tonight."
,,I come to this platform tonight to make a passionate plea to my beloved nation.
,,This speech is not addressed to Hanoi or to the National Liberation Front.
,,It is not addressed to China or to Russia.
,,Nor is it an attempt to overlook the ambiguity of the total situation and the need for a collective solution to the tragedy of Vietnam.
,,"Neither is it an attempt to make North Vietnam or the National Liberation Front paragons of virtue, nor to overlook the role they must play in the successful resolution of the problem."
,,"While they both may have justifiable reasons to be suspicious of the good faith of the United States, life and history give eloquent testimony to the fact that conflicts are never resolved without trustful give and take on both sides."
,,"Tonight, however, I wish not to speak with Hanoi and the National Liberation Front, but rather to my fellow Americans."
,,"Since I am a preacher by calling, I suppose it is not surprising that I have seven major reasons for bringing Vietnam into the field of my moral vision."
,,"There is at the outset a very obvious and almost facile connection between the war in Vietnam and the struggle I, and others, have been waging in America."
,,A few years ago there was a shining moment in that struggle.
,,It seemed as if there was a real promise of hope for the poor -­both black and white -- through the poverty program.
,,"There were experiments, hopes, new beginnings."
,,"Then came the buildup in Vietnam, and I watched this program broken and eviscerated, as if it were some idle political plaything of a society gone mad on war, and I knew that America would never invest the necessary funds or energies in rehabilitation of its poor so long as adventures like Vietnam continued to draw men and skills and money like some demonic destructive suction tube."
,,"So, I was increasingly compelled to see the war as an enemy of the poor and to attack it as such."
,,Perhaps a more tragic recognition of reality took place when it became clear to me that the war was doing far more than devastating the hopes of the poor at home.
,,It was sending their sons and their brothers and their husbands to fight and to die in extraordinarily high proportions relative to the rest of the population.
,,We were taking the black young men who had been crippled by our society and sending them eight thousand miles away to guarantee liberties in Southeast Asia which they had not found in southwest Georgia and East Harlem.
,,And so we have been repeatedly faced with the cruel irony of watching Negro and white boys on TV screens as they kill and die together for a nation that has been unable to seat them together in the same schools.
,,"And so we watch them in brutal solidarity burning the huts of a poor village, but we realize that they would hardly live on the same block in Chicago."
,,I could not be silent in the face of such cruel manipulation of the poor.
,,"My third reason moves to an even deeper level of awareness, for it grows out of my experience in the ghettoes of the North over the last three years -- especially the last three summers."
,,"As I have walked among the desperate, rejected, and angry young men, I have told them that Molotov cocktails and rifles would not solve their problems."
,,I have tried to offer them my deepest compassion while maintaining my conviction that social change comes most meaningfully through nonviolent action.
,,But they ask -- and
,,rightly so -- what about Vietnam?
,,"They ask if our own nation wasn't using massive doses of violence to solve its problems, to bring about the changes it wanted."
,,"Their questions hit home, and I knew that I could never again raise my voice against the violence of the oppressed in the ghettos without having first spoken clearly to the greatest purveyor of violence in the world today -- my own government."
,,"For the sake of those boys, for the sake of this government, for the sake of the hundreds of thousands trembling under our violence, I cannot be silent."
,,"For those who ask the question, ""Aren't you a civil rights leader?"" and thereby mean to exclude me from the movement for peace, I have this further answer."
,,"In 1957 when a group of us formed the Southern Christian Leadership Conference, we chose as our motto: ""To save the soul of America."
,,""" We were convinced that we could not limit our vision to certain rights for black people, but instead affirmed the conviction that America would never be free or saved from itself until the descendants of its slaves were loosed completely from the shackles they still wear."
,,"In a way we were agreeing with Langston Hughes, that black bard of Harlem, who had written earlier:  O, yes,  I say it plain,  America never was America to me,"
,,And yet I swear this oath -­
,,America will be!
,,"Now, it should be incandescently clear that no one who has any concern for the integrity and life of America today can ignore the present war."
,,"If America's soul becomes totally poisoned, part of the autopsy must read: Vietnam."
,,It can never be saved so long as it destroys the deepest hopes of men the world over.
,,"So it is that those of us who are yet determined that America will be -- are -- are led down the path of protest and dissent, working for the health of our land."
,,"As if the weight of such a commitment to the life and health of America were not enough, another burden of responsibility was placed upon me in"
,,1954;1
,,"and I cannot forget that the Nobel Peace Prize was also a commission, a commission to work harder than I had ever worked before for ""the brotherhood of man."
,,""" This is a calling that takes me beyond national allegiances, but even if it were not present I would yet have to live with the meaning of my commitment to the ministry of Jesus Christ."
,,To me the relationship of this ministry to the making of peace is so obvious that I sometimes marvel at those who ask me why I'm speaking against the war.
,,"Could it be that they do not know that the good news was meant for all men -- for Communist and capitalist, for their children and ours, for black and for white, for revolutionary and conservative?"
,,Have they forgotten that my ministry is in obedience to the One who loved his enemies so fully that he died for them?
,,What then can I say to the Vietcong or to Castro or to Mao as a faithful minister of this One?
,,Can I threaten them with death or must I not share with them my life?
,,"And finally, as I try to explain for you and for myself the road that leads from Montgomery to this place I would have offered all that was most valid if I simply said that I must be true to my conviction that I share with all men the calling to be a son of the living God."
,,"Beyond the calling of race or nation or creed is this vocation of sonship and brotherhood, and because I believe that the Father is deeply concerned especially for his suffering and helpless and outcast children, I come tonight to speak for them."
,,This I believe to be the privilege and the burden of all of us who deem ourselves bound by allegiances and loyalties which are broader and deeper than nationalism and which go beyond our nation's self-defined goals and positions.
,,"We are called to speak for the weak, for the voiceless, for the victims of our nation and for those it calls ""enemy,"" for no document from human hands can make these humans any less our brothers."
,,"And as I ponder the madness of Vietnam and search within myself for ways to understand and respond in compassion, my mind goes constantly to the people of that peninsula."
,,"I speak now not of the soldiers of each side, not of the ideologies of the Liberation Front, not of the junta in Saigon, but simply of the people who have been living under the curse of war for almost three continuous decades now."
,,"I think of them, too, because it is clear to me that there will be no meaningful solution there until some attempt is made to know them and hear their broken cries."
,,They must see Americans as strange liberators.
,,The Vietnamese people proclaimed their own independence in 1954 -- in 1945 rather -- after a combined French and Japanese occupation and before the communist revolution in China.
,,They were led by Ho Chi Minh.
,,"Even though they quoted the American Declaration of Independence in their own document of freedom, we refused to recognize them."
,,"Instead, we decided to support France in its reconquest of her former colony."
,,"Our government felt then that the Vietnamese people were not ready for independence, and we again fell victim to the deadly Western arrogance that has poisoned the international atmosphere for so long."
,,With that tragic decision we rejected a revolutionary government seeking self-determination and a government that had been established not by China -- for whom the Vietnamese have no great love -- but by clearly indigenous forces that included some communists.
,,"For the peasants this new government meant real land reform, one of the most important needs in their lives."
,,For nine years following 1945 we denied the people of Vietnam the right of independence.
,,For nine years we vigorously supported the French in their abortive effort to recolonize Vietnam.
,,Before the end of the war we were meeting eighty percent of the French war costs.
,,"Even before the French were defeated at Dien Bien Phu, they began to despair of their reckless action, but we did not."
,,We encouraged them with our huge financial and military supplies to continue the war even after they had lost the will.
,,Soon we would be paying almost the full costs of this tragic attempt at recolonization.
,,"After the French were defeated, it looked as if independence and land reform would come again through the Geneva Agreement."
,,But instead there came the United States
,,", determined that Ho should not unify the temporarily divided nation, and the peasants watched again as we supported one of the most vicious modern dictators, our chosen man, Premier Diem."
,,"The peasants watched and cringed as Diem ruthlessly rooted out all opposition, supported their extortionist landlords, and refused even to discuss reunification with the North."
,,The peasants watched as all this was presided over by United States' influence and
,,then by increasing numbers of United States troops who came to help quell the insurgency that Diem's methods had aroused.
,,"When Diem was overthrown they may have been happy, but the long line of military dictators seemed to offer no real change, especially in terms of their need for land and peace."
,,"The only change came from America, as we increased our troop commitments in support of governments which were singularly corrupt, inept, and without popular support."
,,All the while the people read our leaflets and received the regular promises of peace and democracy and land reform.
,,"Now they languish under our bombs and consider us, not their fellow Vietnamese, the real enemy."
,,They move sadly and apathetically as we herd them off the land of their fathers into concentration camps where minimal social needs are rarely met.
,,They know they must move on or be destroyed by our bombs.
,,"So they go, primarily women and children and the aged."
,,"They watch as we poison their water, as we kill a million acres of their crops."
,,They must weep as the bulldozers roar through their areas preparing to destroy the precious trees.
,,They wander into the hospitals with at least twenty casualties from American firepower for one Vietcong-inflicted injury.
,,"So far we may have killed a million of them, mostly children."
,,"They wander into the towns and see thousands of the children, homeless, without clothes, running in packs on the streets like animals."
,,They see the children degraded by our soldiers as they beg for food.
,,"They see the children selling their sisters to our soldiers, soliciting for their mothers."
,,What do the peasants think as we ally ourselves with the landlords and as we refuse to put any action into our many words concerning land reform?
,,"What do they think as we test out our latest weapons on them, just as the Germans tested out new medicine and new tortures in the concentration camps of Europe?"
,,Where are the roots of the independent Vietnam we claim to be building?
,,Is it among these voiceless ones?
,,We have destroyed their two most cherished institutions: the family and the village.
,,We have destroyed their land and their crops.
,,"We have cooperated in the crushing -- in the crushing of the nation's only non-Communist revolutionary political force, the unified Buddhist Church."
,,We have supported the enemies of the peasants of Saigon.
,,We have corrupted their women and children and killed their men.
,,"Now there is little left to build on, save bitterness."
,,"Soon, the only solid -­solid physical foundations remaining will be found at our military bases and in the concrete of the concentration camps we call ""fortified hamlets."
,,""" The peasants may well wonder if we plan to build our new Vietnam on such grounds as these."
,,Could we blame them for such thoughts?
,,We must speak for them and raise the questions they cannot raise.
,,"These, too, are our brothers."
,,Perhaps a more difficult but no less necessary task is to speak for those who have been designated as our enemies.
,,"What of the National Liberation Front, that strangely anonymous group we call ""VC"" or ""communists""?"
,,"What must they think of the United States of America when they realize that we permitted the repression and cruelty of Diem, which helped to bring them into being as a resistance group in the South?"
,,What do they think of our condoning the violence which led to their own taking up of arms?
,,"How can they believe in our integrity when now we speak of ""aggression from the North"" as if there were nothing more essential to the war?"
,,How can they trust us
,,when now we charge them with violence after the murderous reign of Diem and charge them with violence while we pour every new weapon of death into their land?
,,"Surely we must understand their feelings, even if we do not condone their actions."
,,Surely we must see that the men we supported pressed them to their violence.
,,Surely we must see that our own computerized plans of destruction simply dwarf their greatest acts.
,,"How do they judge us when our officials know that their membership is less than twenty-five percent communist, and yet insist on giving them the blanket name?"
,,"What must they be thinking when they know that we are aware of their control of major sections of Vietnam, and yet we appear ready to allow national elections in which this highly organized political parallel government will not have a part?"
,,They ask how we can speak of free elections when the Saigon press is censored and controlled by the military junta.
,,"And they are surely right to wonder what kind of new government we plan to help form without them, the only party in real touch with the peasants."
,,They question our political goals and they deny the reality of a peace settlement from which they will be excluded.
,,Their questions are frighteningly relevant.
,,"Is our nation planning to build on political myth again, and then shore it up upon the power of new violence?"
,,"Here is the true meaning and value of compassion and nonviolence, when it helps us to see the enemy's point of view, to hear his questions, to know his assessment of ourselves."
,,"For from his view we may indeed see the basic weaknesses of our own condition, and if we are mature, we may learn and grow and profit from the wisdom of the brothers who are called the opposition."
,,"So, too, with Hanoi."
,,"In the North, where our bombs now pummel the land, and our mines endanger the waterways, we are met by a deep but understandable mistrust."
,,"To speak for them is to explain this lack of confidence in Western words, and especially their distrust of American intentions now."
,,"In Hanoi are the men who led the nation to independence against the Japanese and the French, the men who sought membership in the French Commonwealth and were betrayed by the weakness of Paris and the willfulness of the colonial armies."
,,"It was they who led a second struggle against French domination at tremendous costs, and then were persuaded to give up the land they controlled between the thirteenth and seventeenth parallel as a temporary measure at Geneva."
,,"After 1954 they watched us conspire with Diem to prevent elections which could have surely brought Ho Chi Minh to power over a united Vietnam, and they realized they had been betrayed again."
,,"When we ask why they do not leap to negotiate, these things must be remembered."
,,"Also, it must be clear that the leaders of Hanoi considered the presence of American troops in support of the Diem regime to have been the initial military breach of the Geneva Agreement concerning foreign troops."
,,They remind us that they did not begin to send troops in large numbers and even supplies into the South until American forces had moved into the tens of thousands.
,,"Hanoi remembers how our leaders refused to tell us the truth about the earlier North Vietnamese overtures for peace, how the president claimed that none existed when they had clearly been made."
,,"Ho Chi Minh has watched as America has spoken of peace and built up its forces, and now he has surely heard the increasing international rumors of American plans for an invasion of the North."
,,He knows the bombing and shelling and mining we are doing are part of traditional pre-invasion strategy.
,,"Perhaps only his sense of humor and of irony can save him when he hears the most powerful nation of the world speaking of aggression as it drops thousands of bombs on a poor, weak nation"
,,"more than eight hundred -­rather, eight thousand miles away from its shores."
,,"At this point I should make it clear that while I have tried in these last few minutes to give a voice to the voiceless in Vietnam and to understand the arguments of those who are called ""enemy,"" I am as deeply concerned about our own troops there as anything else."
,,For it occurs to me that what we are submitting them to in Vietnam is not simply the brutalizing process that goes on in any war where armies face each other and seek to destroy.
,,"We are adding cynicism to the process of death, for they must know after a short period there that none of the things we claim to be fighting for are really involved."
,,"Before long they must know that their government has sent them into a struggle among Vietnamese, and the more sophisticated surely realize that we are on the side of the wealthy, and the secure, while we create a hell for the poor."
,,Somehow this madness must cease.
,,We must stop now.
,,I speak as a child of God and brother to the suffering poor of Vietnam.
,,"I speak for those whose land is being laid waste, whose homes are being destroyed, whose culture is being subverted."
,,"I speak of the -- for the poor of America who are paying the double price of smashed hopes at home, and death and corruption in Vietnam."
,,"I speak as a citizen of the world, for the world as it stands aghast at the path we have taken."
,,"I speak as one who loves America, to the leaders of our own nation:"
,,The great initiative in this war is ours; the initiative to stop it must be ours.
,,This is the message of the great Buddhist leaders of Vietnam.
,,"Recently one of them wrote these words, and I quote:"
,,Each day the war goes on the hatred increases in the heart of  the Vietnamese and in the hearts of those of humanitarian  instinct.
,,The Americans are forcing even their friends into  becoming their enemies.
,,"It is curious that the Americans, who  calculate so carefully on the possibilities of military victory, do  not realize that in the process they are incurring deep  psychological and political defeat."
,,"The image of America will  never again be the image of revolution, freedom, and  democracy, but the image of violence and militarism"
,,(unquote).
,,"If we continue, there will be no doubt in my mind and in the mind of the world that we have no honorable intentions in Vietnam."
,,"If we do not stop our war against the people of Vietnam immediately, the world will be left with no other alternative than to see this as some horrible, clumsy, and deadly game we have decided to play."
,,The world now demands a maturity of America that we may not be able to achieve.
,,"It demands that we admit that we have been wrong from the beginning of our adventure in Vietnam, that we have been detrimental to the life of the Vietnamese people."
,,The situation is one in which we must be ready to turn sharply from our present ways.
,,"In order to atone for our sins and errors in Vietnam, we should take the initiative in bringing a halt to this tragic war."
,,I would like to suggest five concrete things that our government should do [immediately] to begin the long and difficult process of extricating ourselves from this nightmarish conflict: Number one
,,: End all bombing in North and South Vietnam.
,,Number two: Declare a unilateral cease-fire in the hope that such action will create the atmosphere for negotiation.
,,Three
,,: Take immediate steps to prevent other battlegrounds in Southeast Asia by curtailing our military buildup in Thailand and our interference in Laos.
,,Four: Realistically accept the fact that the National Liberation Front has substantial support in South Vietnam and must thereby play a role in any meaningful negotiations and any future Vietnam government.
,,Five
,,: Set a date that we will remove all foreign troops from Vietnam in accordance with the 1954 Geneva Agreement.
,,Part of our ongoing -- Part of our ongoing commitment might well express itself in an offer to grant asylum to any Vietnamese who fears for his life under a new regime which included the Liberation Front.
,,Then we must make what reparations we can for the damage we have done.
,,"We must provide the medical aid that is badly needed, making it available in this country, if necessary."
,,"Meanwhile -- Meanwhile, we in the churches and synagogues have a continuing task while we urge our government to disengage itself from a disgraceful commitment."
,,We must continue to raise our voices and our lives if our nation persists in its perverse ways in Vietnam.
,,We must be prepared to match actions with words by seeking out every creative method of protest possible.
,,"As we counsel young men concerning military service, we must clarify for them our nation's role in Vietnam and challenge them with the alternative of conscientious objection."
,,"I am pleased to say that this is a path now chosen by more than seventy students at my own alma mater, Morehouse College, and I recommend it to all who find the American course in Vietnam a dishonorable and unjust one."
,,"Moreover, I would encourage all ministers of draft age to give up their ministerial exemptions and seek status as conscientious objectors."
,,These are the times for real choices and not false ones.
,,We are at the moment when our lives must be placed on the line if our nation is to survive its own folly.
,,"Every man of humane convictions must decide on the protest that best suits his convictions, but we must all protest."
,,Now there is something seductively tempting about stopping there and sending us all off on what in some circles has become a popular crusade against the war in Vietnam.
,,"I say we must enter that struggle, but I wish to go on now to say something even more disturbing."
,,"The war in Vietnam is but a symptom of a far deeper malady within the American spirit, and if we ignore this sobering reality...and if we ignore this sobering reality, we will find ourselves organizing ""clergy and laymen concerned"" committees for the next generation."
,,They will be concerned about Guatemala -- Guatemala and Peru.
,,They will be concerned about Thailand and Cambodia.
,,They will be concerned about Mozambique and South Africa.
,,"We will be marching for these and a dozen other names and attending rallies without end, unless there is a significant and profound change in American life and policy."
,,"And so, such thoughts take us beyond Vietnam, but not beyond our calling as sons of the living God."
,,"In 1957, a sensitive American official overseas said that it seemed to him that our nation was on the wrong side of a world revolution."
,,"During the past ten years, we have seen emerge a pattern of suppression which has now justified the presence of U.S. military advisors in Venezuela."
,,This need to maintain social stability for our investments accounts for the counterrevolutionary action of American forces in Guatemala.
,,It tells why American helicopters are being used against guerrillas in Cambodia and why American napalm and Green Beret forces have already been active against rebels in Peru.
,,It is with such activity in mind that the words of the late John F. Kennedy come back to haunt us.
,,"Five years ago he said, ""Those who make peaceful revolution impossible will make violent revolution inevitable."""
,,"Increasingly, by choice or by accident, this is the role our nation has taken, the role of those who make peaceful revolution impossible by refusing to give up the privileges and the pleasures that come from the immense profits of overseas investments."
,,"I am convinced that if we are to get on the right side of the world revolution, we as a nation must undergo a radical revolution of values."
,,We must rapidly begin...
,,we must rapidly begin the shift from a thing-oriented society to a person-oriented society.
,,"When machines and computers, profit motives and property rights, are considered more important than people, the giant triplets of racism, extreme materialism, and militarism are incapable of being conquered."
,,A true revolution of values will soon cause us to question the fairness and justice of many of our past and present policies.
,,"On the one hand, we are called to play the Good Samaritan on life's roadside, but that will be only an initial act."
,,One day we must come to see that the whole Jericho Road must be transformed so that men and women will not be constantly beaten and robbed as they make their journey on life's highway.
,,True compassion is more than flinging a coin to a beggar.
,,It comes to see that an edifice which produces beggars needs restructuring.
,,A true revolution of values will soon look uneasily on the glaring contrast of poverty and wealth.
,,"With righteous indignation, it will look across the seas and see individual capitalists of the West investing huge sums of money in Asia, Africa, and South America, only to take the profits out with no concern for the social betterment of the countries, and say, ""This is not just."
,,""" It will look at our alliance with the landed gentry of South America and say, ""This is not just."
,,""""
,,The Western arrogance of feeling that it has everything to teach others and nothing to learn from them is not just.
,,"A true revolution of values will lay hand on the world order and say of war, ""This way of settling differences is not just."""
,,"This business of burning human beings with napalm, of filling our nation's homes with orphans and widows, of injecting poisonous drugs of hate into the veins of peoples normally humane, of sending men home from dark and bloody battlefields physically handicapped and psychologically deranged, cannot be reconciled with wisdom, justice, and love."
,,A nation that continues year after year to spend more money on military defense than on programs of social uplift is approaching spiritual death.
,,"America, the richest and most powerful nation in the world, can well lead the way in this revolution of values."
,,There is nothing except a tragic death wish to prevent us from reordering our priorities so that the pursuit of peace will take precedence over the pursuit of war.
,,There is nothing to keep us from molding a recalcitrant status quo with bruised hands until we have fashioned it into a brotherhood.
,,This kind of positive revolution of values is our best defense against communism.
,,War is not the answer.
,,Communism will never be defeated by the use of atomic bombs or nuclear weapons.
,,"Let us not join those who shout war and, through their misguided passions, urge the United States to relinquish its participation in the United Nations."
,,These are days which demand wise restraint and calm reasonableness.
,,"We must not engage in a negative anticommunism, but rather in a positive thrust for democracy, realizing that our greatest defense against communism is to take offensive action in behalf of justice."
,,"We must with positive action seek to remove those conditions of poverty, insecurity, and injustice, which are the fertile soil in which the seed of communism grows and develops."
,,These are revolutionary times.
,,"All over the globe men are revolting against old systems of exploitation and oppression, and out of the wounds of a frail world, new systems of justice and equality are being born."
,,The shirtless and barefoot people of the land are rising up as never before.
,,"""The people who sat in darkness have seen a great light.""2"
,,We in the West must support these revolutions.
,,"It is a sad fact that because of comfort, complacency, a morbid fear of communism, and our proneness to adjust to injustice, the Western nations that initiated so much of the revolutionary spirit of the modern world have now become the arch antirevolutionaries."
,,This has driven many to feel that only Marxism has a revolutionary spirit.
,,"Therefore, communism is a judgment against our failure to make democracy real and follow through on the revolutions that we initiated."
,,"Our only hope today lies in our ability to recapture the revolutionary spirit and go out into a sometimes hostile world declaring eternal hostility to poverty, racism, and militarism."
,,"With this powerful commitment we shall boldly challenge the status quo and unjust mores, and thereby speed the day when ""every valley shall be exalted, and every mountain and hill shall be made low, and the crooked  shall be made straight, and the rough places plain.""3  A genuine revolution of values means in the final analysis that our loyalties must become ecumenical rather than sectional."
,,Every nation must now develop an overriding loyalty to mankind as a whole in order to preserve the best in their individual societies.

,,"But I'd like to use a subject from which to speak this afternoon, the Other America."
,,And I use this subject because there are literally two Americas.
,,One America is beautiful for situation.
,,"And, in a sense, this America is overflowing with the milk of prosperity and the honey of opportunity."
,,This America is the habitat of millions of people who have food and material necessities for their bodies; and culture and education for their minds; and freedom and human dignity for their spirits.
,,"In this America, millions of people experience every day the opportunity of having life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness in all of their dimensions."
,,And in this America millions of young people grow up in the sunlight of opportunity.
,,"But tragically and unfortunately, there is another America."
,,This other America has a daily ugliness about it that constantly transforms the ebulliency of hope into the fatigue of despair.
,,In this America millions of work-starved men walk the streets daily in search for jobs that do not exist.
,,"In this America millions of people find themselves living in rat-infested, vermin-filled slums."
,,In this America people are poor by the millions.
,,They find themselves perishing on a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity.
,,"In a sense, the greatest tragedy of this other America is what it does to little children."
,,Little children in this other America are forced to grow up with clouds of inferiority forming every day in their little mental skies.
,,"As we look at this other America, we see it as an arena of blasted hopes and shattered dreams."
,,Many people of various backgrounds live in this other America.
,,"Some are Mexican Americans, some are Puerto Ricans, some are Indians, some happen to be from other groups."
,,Millions of them are Appalachian whites.
,,But probably the largest group in this other America in proportion to its size in the Population is the American Negro.
,,The American Negro finds himself living in a triple ghetto.
,,"A ghetto of race, a ghetto of poverty, a ghetto of human misery."
,,So what we are seeking to do in the Civil Rights Movement is to deal with this problem.
,,To deal with this problem of the two Americas.
,,"We are seeking to make America one nation, Indivisible, with liberty and justice for all."
,,"Now let me say that the struggle for Civil Rights and the struggle to make these two Americas one America, is much more difficult today than it was five or ten years ago."
,,"For about a decade or maybe twelve years, we've struggled all across the South in glorious struggles to get rid of legal, overt segregation and all of the humiliation that surrounded that system of segregation."
,,In a sense this was a struggle for decency; we could not go to a lunch counter in so many instances and get a hamburger or a cup of coffee.
,,We could not make use of public accommodations.
,,"Public transportation was segregated, and often we had to sit in the back and within transportation —"
,,transportation within cities — we often had to stand over empty seats because sections were reserved for whites only.
,,We did not have the right to vote in so many areas of the South.
,,And the struggle was to deal with these problems.
,,"And certainly they were difficult problems, they were humiliating conditions."
,,By the thousands we protested these conditions.
,,We made it clear that it was ultimately more honorable to accept jail cell experiences than to accept segregation and humiliation.
,,By the thousands students and adults decided to sit in at segregated lunch counters to protest conditions there.
,,When they were sitting at those lunch counters they were in reality standing up for the best in the American dream and seeking to take the whole nation back to those great wells of democracy which were dug deep by the Founding Fathers in the formulation of the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.
,,Many things were gained as a result of these years of struggle.
,,In 1964 the Civil Rights Bill came into being after the Birmingham movement which did a great deal to subpoena the conscience of a large segment of the nation to appear before the judgment seat of morality on the whole question of Civil Rights.
,,After the Selma movement in 1965 we were able to get a Voting Rights Bill.
,,And all of these things represented strides.
,,But we must see that the struggle today is much more difficult.
,,It's more difficult today because we are struggling now for genuine equality.
,,It's much easier to integrate a lunch counter than it is to guarantee a livable income and a good solid job.
,,"It's much easier to guarantee the right to vote than it is to guarantee the right to live in sanitary, decent housing conditions."
,,"It is much easier to integrate a public park than it is to make genuine, quality, integrated education a reality."
,,And so today we are struggling for something which says we demand genuine equality.
,,It's not merely a struggle against extremist behavior toward Negroes.
,,And I'm convinced that many of the very people who supported us in the struggle in the South are not willing to go all the way now.
,,I came to see this in a very difficult and painful way.
,,In Chicago the last year where I've lived and worked.
,,Some of the people who came quickly to march with us in Selma and Birmingham weren't active around Chicago.
,,"And I came to see that so many people who supported morally and even financially what we were doing in Birmingham and Selma, were really outraged against the extremist behavior of Bull Connor and Jim Clark toward Negroes, rather than believing in genuine equality for Negroes."
,,"And I think this is what we've gotta see now, and this is what makes the struggle much more difficult."
,,"So as a result of all of this, we see many problems existing today that are growing more difficult."
,,"It's something that is often overlooked, but Negroes generally live in worse slums today than 20 or 25 years ago."
,,In the North schools are more segregated today than they were in 1954 when the Supreme Court's decision on desegregation was rendered.
,,Economically the Negro Is worse off today than he was 15 and 20 years ago.
,,And so the unemployment rate among Whites at one time was about the same as the unemployment rate among Negroes.
,,But today the unemployment rate among Negroes is twice that of Whites.
,,And the average income of the Negro is today 50% less than Whites.
,,As we look at these problems we see them growing and developing every day.
,,We see the fact that the Negro economically is facing a depression in his everyday life that is more staggering than the depression of the 30's.
,,The unemployment rate of the nation as a whole is about 4%.
,,Statistics would say from the Labor Department that among Negroes it's about 8.4%.
,,"But these are the persons who are in the labor market, who still go to employment agencies to seek jobs, and so they can be calculated."
,,The statistics can be gotten because they are still somehow in the labor market.
,,But there are hundreds of thousands of Negroes who have given up.
,,They've lost hope.
,,"They've come to feel that life is a long and desolate corridor for them with no Exit sign, and so they no longer go to look for a job."
,,"There are those who would estimate that these persons, who are called the Discouraged Persons, these 6 or 7% in the Negro community, that means that unemployment among Negroes may well be 16%."
,,Among Negro youth in some of our larger urban areas it goes to 30 and 40%.
,,"So you can see what I mean when I say that, in the Negro community, there is a major, tragic and staggering depression that we face in our everyday lives."
,,Now the other thing that we've gotta come to see now that many of us didn't see too well during the last ten years —
,,that is that racism is still alive in American society.
,,And much more wide-spread than we realized.
,,And we must see racism for what it is.
,,It is a myth of the superior and the inferior race.
,,"It is the false and tragic notion that one particular group, one particular race is responsible for all of the progress, all of the insights in the total flow of history."
,,"And the theory that another group or another race is totally depraved, innately impure, and innately inferior."
,,"In the final analysis, racism is evil because its ultimate logic is genocide."
,,Hitler was a sick and tragic man who carried racism to its logical conclusion.
,,He ended up leading a nation to the point of killing about 6 million Jews.
,,This is the tragedy of racism because its ultimate logic is genocide.
,,"If one says that I am not good enough to live next door to him; if one says that I am not good enough to eat at a lunch counter, or to have a good, decent job, or to go to school with him merely because of my race, he is saying consciously or unconsciously that I do not deserve to exist."
,,"To use a philosophical analogy here, racism is not based on some empirical generalization; it is based rather on an ontological affirmation."
,,It is not the assertion that certain people are behind culturally or otherwise because of environmental conditions.
,,It is the affirmation that the very being of a people is inferior.
,,And this is the great tragedy of it.
,,I submit that however unpleasant it is we must honestly see and admit that racism is still deeply rooted all over America.
,,"It is still deeply rooted in the North, and it's still deeply rooted in the South."
,,"And this leads me to say something about another discussion that we hear a great deal, and that is the so-called ""white backlash""."
,,I would like to honestly say to you that the white backlash is merely a new name for an old phenomenon.
,,"It's not something that just came into being because of shouts of Black Power, or because Negroes engaged in riots in Watts, for instance."
,,"The fact is that the state of California voted a Fair Housing bill out of existence before anybody shouted Black Power, or before anybody rioted in Watts."
,,"It may well be that shouts of Black Power and riots in Watts and the Harlems and the other areas, are the consequences of the white backlash rather than the cause of them."
,,What it is necessary to see is that there has never been a single solid monistic determined commitment on the part of the vast majority of white Americans on the whole question of Civil Rights and on the whole question of racial equality.
,,This is something that truth impels all men of good will to admit.
,,It is said on the Statue of Liberty that America is a home of exiles.
,,It doesn't take us long to realize that America has been the home of its white exiles from Europe.
,,But it has not evinced the same kind of maternal care and concern for its black exiles from Africa.
,,"It is no wonder that in one of his sorrow songs, the Negro could sing out, ""Sometimes I feel like a motherless child."""
,,"What great estrangement, what great sense of rejection caused a people to emerge with such a metaphor as they looked over their lives."
,,What I'm trying to get across is that our nation has constantly taken a positive step forward on the question of racial justice and racial equality.
,,"But over and over again at the same time, it made certain backward steps."
,,And this has been the persistence of the so called white backlash.
,,In 1863 the Negro was freed from the bondage of physical slavery.
,,"But at the same time, the nation refused to give him land to make that freedom meaningful."
,,"And at that same period America was giving millions of acres of land in the West and the Midwest, which meant that America was willing to undergird its white peasants from Europe with an economic floor that would make it possible to grow and develop, and refused to give that economic floor to its black peasants, so to speak."
,,"This is why Frederick Douglas could say that emancipation for the Negro was freedom to hunger, freedom to the winds and rains of heaven, freedom without roofs to cover their heads."
,,"He went on to say that it was freedom without bread to eat, freedom without land to cultivate."
,,It was freedom and famine at the same time.
,,But it does not stop there.
,,In 1875 the nation passed a Civil Rights Bill and refused to enforce it.
,,"In 1964 the nation passed a weaker Civil Rights Bill and even to this day, that bill has not been totally enforced in all of its dimensions."
,,"The nation heralded a new day of concern for the poor, for the poverty stricken, for the disadvantaged."
,,"And brought into being a Poverty Bill and at the same time it put such little money into the program that it was hardly, and still remains hardly, a good skirmish against poverty."
,,"White politicians in suburbs talk eloquently against open housing, and in the same breath contend that they are not racist."
,,"And all of this, and all of these things tell us that America has been backlashing on the whole question of basic constitutional and God-given rights for Negroes and other disadvantaged groups for more than 300 years."
,,"So these conditions, existence of widespread poverty, slums, and of tragic conniptions in schools and other areas of life, all of these things have brought about a great deal of despair, and a great deal of desperation."
,,A great deal of disappointment and even bitterness in the Negro communities.
,,And today all of our cities confront huge problems.
,,All of our cities are potentially powder kegs as a result of the continued existence of these conditions.
,,"Many in moments of anger, many in moments of deep bitterness engage in riots."
,,"Let me say as I've always said, and I will always continue to say, that riots are socially destructive and self-defeating."
,,I'm still convinced that nonviolence is the most potent weapon available to oppressed people in their struggle for freedom and justice.
,,I feel that violence will only create more social problems than they will solve.
,,That in a real sense it is impracticable for the Negro to even think of mounting a violent revolution in the United States.
,,"So I will continue to condemn riots, and continue to say to my brothers and sisters that this is not the way."
,,And continue to affirm that there is another way.
,,"But at the same time, it is as necessary for me to be as vigorous in condemning the conditions which cause persons to feel that they must engage in riotous activities as it is for me to condemn riots."
,,I think America must see that riots do not develop out of thin air.
,,Certain conditions continue to exist in our society which must be condemned as vigorously as we condemn riots.
,,"But in the final analysis, a riot is the language of the unheard."
,,And what is it that America has failed to hear?
,,It has failed to hear that the plight of the Negro poor has worsened over the last few years.
,,It has failed to hear that the promises of freedom and justice have not been met.
,,"And it has failed to hear that large segments of white society are more concerned about tranquility and the status quo than about justice, equality, and humanity."
,,And so in a real sense our nation's summers of riots are caused by our nation's winters of delay.
,,"And as long as America postpones justice, we stand in the position of having these recurrences of violence and riots over and over again."
,,Social justice and progress are the absolute guarantors of riot prevention.
,,"Now let me go on to say that if we are to deal with all of the problems that I've talked about, and if we are to bring America to the point that we have one nation, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all, there are certain things that we must do."
,,The job ahead must be massive and positive.
,,We must develop massive action programs all over the United States of America in order to deal with the problems that I have mentioned.
,,Now in order to develop these massive action programs we've got to get rid of one or two false notions that continue to exist in our society.
,,One is the notion that only time can solve the problem of racial injustice.
,,I'm sure you've heard this idea.
,,It is the notion almost that there is something in the very flow of time that will miraculously cure all evils.
,,And I've heard this over and over again.
,,"There are those, and they are often sincere people, who say to Negroes and their allies In the white community, that we should slow up and just be nice and patient and continue to pray, and in a hundred or two hundred years the problem will work itself out because only time can solve the problem."
,,I think there is an answer to that myth.
,,And it is that time is neutral.
,,It can be used either constructively or destructively.
,,"And I'm absolutely convinced that the forces of ill-will in our nation, the extreme rightists in our nation, have often used time much more effectively than the forces of good will."
,,"And it may well be that we will have to repent in this generation not merely for the vitriolic words of the bad people and the violent actions of the bad people, but for the appalling silence and indifference of the good people who sit around and say wait on time."
,,Somewhere we must come to see that social progress never rolls in on the wheels of inevitability.
,,It comes through the tireless efforts and the persistent work of dedicated Individuals.
,,And without this hard work time itself becomes an ally of the primitive forces of social stagnation.
,,"And so we must help time, and we must realize that the time is always right to do right."
,,"Now there's another notion that gets out, it's around everywhere."
,,"It's in the South, it's in the North, it's In California, and all over our nation."
,,"It's the notion that legislation can't solve the problem, it can't do anything in this area."
,,And those who project this argument contend that you've got to change the heart and that you can't change the heart through legislation.
,,"Now I would be the first one to say that there is real need for a lot of heart changing in our country, and I believe in changing the heart."
,,I preach about it.
,,"I believe in the need for conversion in many instances, and regeneration, to use theological terms."
,,"And I would be the first to say that if the race problem In America is to be solved, the white person must treat the Negro right, not merely because the law says it, but because it's natural, because It's right, and because the Negro is his brother."
,,"And so I realize that if we are to have a truly integrated society, men and women will have to rise to the majestic heights of being obedient to the unenforceable."
,,"But after saying this, let me say another thing which gives the other side, and that is that although it may be true that morality cannot be legislated, behavior can be regulated."
,,"Even though it may be true that the law cannot change the heart, it can restrain the heartless."
,,"Even though it may be true that the law cannot make a man love me, it can restrain him from lynching me."
,,And I think that's pretty important also.
,,"And so while the law may not change the hearts of men, it can and it does change the habits of men."
,,"And when you begin to change the habits of men, pretty soon the attitudes will be changed; pretty soon the hearts will be changed."
,,And I'm convinced that we still need strong civil rights legislation.
,,And there is a bill before Congress right now to have a national or federal Open Housing Bill.
,,A federal law declaring discrimination in housing unconstitutional.
,,And also a bill to make the administration of justice real all over our country.
,,Now nobody can doubt the need for this.
,,"Nobody can doubt the need if he thinks about the fact that since 1963 some 50 Negroes and white Civil Rights workers have been brutally murdered in the state of Mississippi alone, and not a single person has been convicted for these dastardly crimes."
,,There have been some indictments but no one has been convicted.
,,And so there is a need for a federal law dealing with the whole question of the administration of justice.
,,There is a need for fair housing laws all over our country.
,,And it is tragic indeed that Congress last year allowed this bill to die.
,,"And when that bill died in Congress, a bit of democracy died, a bit of our commitment to justice died."
,,"If it happens again in this session of Congress, a greater degree of our commitment to democratic principles will die."
,,And I can see no more dangerous trend in our country than the constant developing of predominantly Negro central cities ringed by white suburbs.
,,This is only inviting social disaster.
,,"And the only way this problem will be solved is by the nation taking a strong stand, and by state governments taking a strong stand against housing segregation and against discrimination in all of these areas."
,,Now there's another thing that I'd like to mention as I talk about the massive action program and time will not permit me to go into specific programmatic action to any great degree.
,,But it must be realized now that the Negro cannot solve the problems by himself.
,,"There again, there are those who always say to Negroes, ""Why don't you do something for yourself?"
,,"Why don't you lift yourselves by your own bootstraps?"""
,,And we hear this over and over again.
,,Now certainly there are many things that we must do for ourselves and that only we can do for ourselves.
,,Certainly we must develop within a sense of dignity and self-respect that nobody else can give us.
,,"A sense of manhood, a sense of personhood, a sense of not being ashamed of our heritage, not being ashamed of our color."
,,"It was wrong and tragic of the Negro ever to allow himself to be ashamed of the fact that he was black, or ashamed of the fact that his ancestral home was Africa."
,,And so there is a great deal that the Negro can do to develop self respect.
,,There is a great deal that the Negro must do and can do to amass political and economic power within his own community and by using his own resources.
,,"And so we must do certain things for ourselves but this must not negate the fact, and cause the nation to overlook the fact, that the Negro cannot solve the problem himself."
,,"A man was on the plane with me some weeks ago and he came up to me and said, ""The problem, Dr. King, that I see with what you all are doing is that every time I see you and other Negroes, you're protesting and you aren't doing anything for yourselves."""
,,"And he went on to tell me that he was very poor at one time, and he was able to make by doing something for himself."
,,"""Why don't you teach your people,"" he said, ""to lift themselves by their own bootstraps?"""
,,"And then he went on to say other groups faced disadvantages, the Irish, the Italian, and he went down the line."
,,"And I said to him that it does not help the Negro, it only deepens his frustration, upon feeling insensitive people to say to him that other ethnic groups who migrated or were immigrants to this country less than a hundred years or so ago, have gotten beyond him and he came here some 344 years ago."
,,"And I went on to remind him that the Negro came to this country involuntarily in chains, while others came voluntarily."
,,I went on to remind him that no other racial group has been a slave on American soil.
,,"I went on to remind him that the other problem we have faced over the years is that this society placed a stigma on the color of the Negro, on the color of his skin because he was black."
,,Doors were closed to him that were not closed to other groups.
,,"And I finally said to him that it's a nice thing to say to people that you oughta lift yourself by your own bootstraps, but it is a cruel jest to say to a bootless man that he oughta lift himself by his own bootstraps."
,,"And the fact is that millions of Negroes, as a result of centuries of denial and neglect, have been left bootless."
,,They find themselves impoverished aliens in this affluent society.
,,And there is a great deal that the society can and must do if the Negro is to gain the economic security that he needs.
,,"Now one of the answers it seems to me, is a guaranteed annual income, a guaranteed minimum income for all people, and for our families of our country."
,,It seems to me that the Civil Rights movement must now begin to organize for the guaranteed annual income.
,,"Begin to organize people all over our country, and mobilize forces so that we can bring to the attention of our nation this need, and this is something which I believe will go a long long way toward dealing with the Negro's economic problem and the economic problem which many other poor people confront in our nation."
,,"Now I said I wasn't going to talk about Vietnam, but I can't make a speech without mentioning some of the problems that we face there because I think this war has diverted attention from civil rights."
,,It has strengthened the forces of reaction in our country and has brought to the forefront the military-industrial complex that even President Eisenhower warned us against at one time.
,,"And above all, it is destroying human lives."
,,It's destroying the lives of thousands of the young promising men of our nation.
,,It's destroying the lives of little boys and little girls In Vietnam.
,,But one of the greatest things that this war is doing to us in Civil Rights is that it is allowing the Great Society to be shot down on the battlefields of Vietnam every day.
,,And I submit this afternoon that we can end poverty in the United States.
,,Our nation has the resources to do it.
,,The National Gross Product of America will rise to the astounding figure of some $780 billion this year.
,,"We have the resources: The question is, whether our nation has the will, and I submit that if we can spend $35 billion a year to fight an ill-considered war in Vietnam, and $20 billion to put a man on the moon, our nation can spend billions of dollars to put God's children on their own two feet right here on earth."
,,"Let me say another thing that's more in the realm of the spirit I guess,"
,,"that is that if we are to go on in the days ahead and make true brotherhood a reality, it is necessary for us to realize more than ever before, that the destinies of the Negro and the white man are tied together."
,,Now there are still a lot of people who don't realize this.
,,The racists still don't realize this.
,,"But it is a fact now that Negroes and whites are tied together, and we need each other."
,,The Negro needs the white man to save him from his fear.
,,The white man needs the Negro to save him from his guilt.
,,"We are tied together in so many ways, our language, our music, our cultural patterns, our material prosperity, and even our food are an amalgam of black and white."
,,So there can be no separate black path to power and fulfillment that does not intersect white groups.
,,There can be no separate white path to power and fulfillment short of social disaster.
,,It does not recognize the need of sharing that power with black aspirations for freedom and justice.
,,We must come to see now that integration is not merely a romantic or esthetic something where you merely add color to a still predominantly white power structure.
,,"Integration must be seen also in political terms where there is shared power, where black men and white men share power together to build a new and a great nation."
,,"In a real sense, we are all caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny."
,,"John Donne placed it years ago in graphic terms, ""No man is an island entire of itself."
,,"Every man is a piece of the continent, a part of the main."""
,,"And he goes on toward the end to say, ""Any man's death diminishes me because I'm Involved in mankind."
,,Therefore never send to know for whom the bell tolls.
,,"It tolls for thee."""
,,And so we are all in the same situation: the salvation of the Negro will mean the salvation of the white man.
,,And the destruction of life and of the ongoing progress of the Negro will be the destruction of the ongoing progress of the nation.
,,Now let me say finally that we have difficulties ahead
,,but I haven't despaired.
,,Somehow I maintain hope in spite of hope.
,,And I've talked about the difficulties and how hard the problems will be as we tackle them.
,,"But I want to close by saying this afternoon, that I still have faith in the future."
,,And I still believe that these problems can be solved.
,,And so I will not join anyone who will say that we still can't develop a coalition of conscience.
,,I realize and understand the discontent and the agony and the disappointment and even the bitterness of those who feel that whites in America cannot be trusted.
,,And I would be the first to say that there are all too many who are still guided by the racist ethos.
,,And I am still convinced that there are still many white persons of good will.
,,"And I'm happy to say that I see them every day in the student generation who cherish democratic principles and justice above principle, and who will stick with the cause of justice and the cause of Civil Rights and the cause of peace throughout the days ahead."
,,And so I refuse to despair.
,,"I think we're gonna achieve our freedom because however much America strays away from the ideals of justice, the goal of America is freedom."
,,"Abused and scorned though we may be, our destiny is tied up in the destiny of America."
,,Before the pilgrim fathers landed at Plymouth we were here.
,,"Before Jefferson etched across the pages of history the majestic words of the Declaration of Independence, we were here."
,,"Before the beautiful words of the Star Spangled Banner were written, we were here."
,,"For more than two centuries, our forebearers labored here without wages."
,,They made cotton king.
,,They built the homes of their masters in the midst of the most humiliating and oppressive conditions.
,,"And yet out of a bottomless vitality, they continued to grow and develop."
,,"And I say that if the inexpressible cruelties of slavery couldn't stop us, the opposition that we now face, including the so-called white backlash, will surely fail."
,,We're gonna win our freedom because both the sacred heritage of our nation and the eternal will of the Almighty God are embodied in our echoing demands.
,,"And so I can still sing ""We Shall Overcome."
,,""" We shall overcome because the arc of the moral universe is long but it bends toward Justice."
,,"We shall overcome because Carlyle is right, ""No lie can live forever."
,,""" We shall overcome because William Cullen Bryant is right, ""Truth crushed to earth will rise again."
,,""" We shall overcome because James Russell Lowell is right, ""Truth forever on the scaffold, Wrong forever on the throne —"
,,Yet that scaffold sways the future.
,,""" With this faith, we will be able to hew out of the mountain of despair a stone of hope."
,,"With this faith, we will be able to transform the jangling discourse of our nation into a beautiful symphony of brotherhood."
,,"With this faith, we will be able to speed up the day when all of God's children, black men and white men, Jews and Gentiles, Protestants and Catholics, will be able to join hands and live together as brothers and sisters, all over this great nation."
,,"That will be a great day, that will be a great tomorrow."
,,"In the words of the Scripture, to speak symbolically, that will be the day when the morning stars will sing together and the sons of God will shout for joy."
